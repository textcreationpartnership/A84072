         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I confeſs that I have been always very much an admirer (but yet no Idolizer) of all the Liturgick Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as they are now ſetled and eſtabliſhed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and this induced me to write my <hi>Expoſition</hi> upon the firſt part of the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book,</hi> and now to add this <hi>Expoſition</hi> upon the latter part; what lies betwixt theſe two parts, I confeſs I have taken the like pains upon, but am not in a capacity to make pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, (Bricks cannot be made up to the full

The end (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve moſt Readers will agree with me ſo far) was not to perſwade ſome People to have any better opinion of me for vindicating our Church, but all to have a better opinion of our Church, which to vindicate, may in the Opinion of ſome be crime enough. The emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Men that stand by me in this very Treatiſe, are Perſons ſo far from being thought mean and contemptible, by thoſe who know how to value what is truly valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that they were indeed the glory and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of our Nation, by exemplary live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as well as the Pillars of our Religion and Church, by their ſound, ſober, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found learning; ſuch as the moſt judicious <hi>Hooker,</hi> the moſt ſolid and ſearching <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi> the moſt elaborate and learned <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, cum caeteris,</hi>— I have not, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, given them thoſe ſplendid titles, which they deſerve, becauſe they have by their own

               <p>After this Exhortation, the Miniſter is to rehearſe to the ſick party the Articles of our faith, that the party may know whether he believes as a Chriſtian Man ſhould or no.

                        <hi>Note</hi> here once for all, that a very great part of the Service-Book, or Common-Prayer, may be reſolved into this <hi>Creed,</hi> and was the Method of the Common-Prayer warily and conſiderately obſerved, the Apoſtles Creed would need no other explication then what the Church in her Liturgick Office hath in one part or other, one office or other clearly made out to our hands. I am very confident the Service-Book cannot be faulty in any one thing, unleſs it will be confeſt that this confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of faith, according to which moſt of the Service is compoſed, be faulty alſo. 1. The <hi>Te Deum.</hi> The <hi>Athanaſian,</hi> and the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creeds, are but explications of this, and the growth of hereſies in the Church, gave the occaſion to thoſe expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, that the Members of the Church might be the better ſecured from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of them. 2. The <hi>Gloria patri,</hi> &amp;c. ſo often repeated, is but a ſhorter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Trinity, which this Creed teacheth us to believe in. 3. The Lord have mercy.

                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:136233:19"/> Lord have mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is the leſſer Litany, uſed in all Divine Offices, is of the ſame uſe and deſign. 4. The greater Litany, which begins, <hi>O God the Father of Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. is, as to the firſt part of it, the very ſame; and thoſe paſſages in it, which ſome ſcruple at, <hi>By the myſtery of thy holy Incarnation,</hi> &amp;c. is but a pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical enumeration of all thoſe acts and paſſages of our Redeemer mention'd in this Creed, by which we pray for deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, and without which our deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance we pray for could not poſſibly be obtain'd. 5. Many of the Collects, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, and Goſpels for the Dominicals, and Feſtivals may be reduced to this Creed, and may ſerve for a clear expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it.

The ſick Perſon, when he leaves the World, muſt forgive the World, and, as the <hi>Athenian</hi> turn'd his Cup of Poyſon into a Cup of Charity, ſo a dying Chriſtian ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt every injury done to him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite it with a kindneſs, rather than medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate a Revenge, as did our late glorious

So he inforc'd it on by his own practiſe. <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.34. <hi>In perſecutione poſitus pro perſequentibus o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabat;</hi> what his laſt and dying words were <hi>in Cruce,</hi> ſuch ſhould be ours in <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trema hac luce.</hi> He dies deſperately, who dies uncharitably; how can he expect forgiveneſs from God, who forgives not Man? The parable of the <hi>Servus nequam. Matth.</hi> 18.33, 34. may caution us to let go wrath and malice, before we leave the World. 2. The ſick Perſon is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd, how he ſtands diſpoſed to make ſatisfaction to thoſe he hath done injury to. For without this, Repentance will not
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:136233:22"/> profit, becauſe it can hardly be true and ſincere without reſtitution. <hi>Fingitur non agitur. Non remittitur peccatum niſi reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuatur ablatum. Auguſt. Epiſt.</hi> 5. <hi>Chryſoſt. Homil.</hi> 15. in <hi>Matth.</hi> Now in the buſineſs of reſtitution, it is intended only ſo far to be made by the Sick party, as that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty injur'd may be no looſer by him. That he reſtore what he took away, if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.14, 15. if not that, yet to have a will and heart ſo to do, God will accept of a <hi>Quod potuit,</hi> ſo far as we are able in ſuch a caſe. <hi>Pro facto reputat Deus, quod homo quidem vere voluit, ſed non valuit adimplere.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. If a Man does according to his ability, that ſhall be accepted at Gods hands, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, neither ſhall that be expected from him, which he is not able to do. Now in regard of a late prejudice againſt Miniſters, and their maintenance, which bad Men, by the advantage of bad times have contracted, People have been more inclined to injure, rob, and defraud their Miniſters than any other, to the very great ſcandal of Chriſtian profeſſion, therefore it is not amiſs in this place to give ſome

Therefore in time of health, let a Man ſet his Houſe in order, and not defer it till the evil days come. The only full imployment for a ſick Man is to prepare to dye, which ſhould be the work of his whole life, but now he is to intend it and nothing elſe, make it his <hi>Hoc age,</hi> his <hi>Unum neceſſarium.</hi> In his life time, and time of ſanity, he ſhould keep his Lamp burning, and prepare his Oyl, but <hi>in extremis,</hi> he ſhould trim it, and get it in a readineſs, that he may have nothing to do, but to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:136233:23"/> go forth to meet him, when the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom calls. Again, the Miniſter is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort the ſick Perſon, if he be of ability to be liberal to the poor; For this is to have mercy upon our own Souls: In not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the Poor, we remember our ſelvs. This is <hi>Chriſtum ſcribere haeredem,</hi> to make Chriſt our Heir. <hi>Manus pauperis est the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaurus Chriſti.</hi> The poor Man's hand is <hi>Christ</hi>'s treaſury. When the poor receives from us, <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſtands by, and reaches out his hand to receive with them. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.40. This is <hi>Ars quaeſtuoſiſſima.</hi> For by thus parting with the Riches, which we cannot keep, we may gain thoſe Riches, which we cannot loſe. <hi>Quas dederis ſolas ſemper habebis opes.</hi> This is not to throw away our Riches, but to lay them out with ſuch prudence, as to make friends of the unrighteous Mammon. <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.9.

A duty very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary at all times, but moſt needful then, when we are going to give up our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:136233:23"/> to God: for nothing ſeems more powerful to procure abſolution at God's hands, than liberality to the Poor. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.34, 35. Our charity cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat without this, it is not enough to forgive injuries, but to give almes; this is called doing good, and they, in whom this grace hath abounded, are ſaid to be rich in good works. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17, 18, 19. What we do for the poor, we do for our ſelves too, more for our ſelves then for them; this is to do our ſelves good, this is to lay up for our ſelves; this is to lay a ſure foundation, and to make a ſure and certain ground work of the uncertainty of Riches. Our good works are our only moveables, which ſhall follow us to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, and no time more ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for them then ſickneſs, when we are packing up to be gone.

Touching the firſt, it cannot be meant of that auricular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, which is corruptly practiſed, for no more is intended by it, then that the Miniſter ſhould contribute his utmoſt aid and aſſiſtance towards the removal of that great burden of guilt, which by reaſon of ſin may lie upon the ſick Man's Conſcience. This the Miniſters ought to do, for this very end and purpoſe is the Miniſtry of reconciliation committed unto them, they have a Commiſſion granted them to give reconciliation, peace, pardon, and abſolution to ſinners, upon their ſincere repentance, and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their lives. And the Tenure of their Commiſſion is this, That God hath uſed <hi>Christ</hi> as a means to make peace between Him and the ſinful World, not by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning their ſins, whilſt they remain in them, but by admitting them to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, by calling them, and uſing admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable methods of mercy in revealing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto them; which word of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:136233:24"/> is put into the Miniſters hands, that they may upon all needful occaſions make known the means of grace, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe and perſwade all who need it, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the ſick and grieved in conſcience, to make uſe of it. The Miniſters imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to be as Negotiators for <hi>Christ,</hi> to ſupply <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s place on earth, and to treat with Men after the ſame manner, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> did when he was upon the Earth, by calling them to repentance, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching them to reform their lives, and make themſelves capable of the return of God's favour to them. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18, 19, 20. When the Miniſter hath done this, and the ſick party hath received ſome large meaſure of ſatisfaction from him, then upon his ſerious and unfeigned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance (if it be deſired) he is to give him abſolution, ſaying, <hi>I abſolve thee,</hi> &amp;c. But here we are to take notice, that there are three opinions, touching the Miniſters abſolution. 1. That it is only optative and precarious: So in the Abſolution for the Communion-Office. 2. That it is only declaratory pronouncing the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent abſolved, by applying God's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:136233:25"/> to the ſigns of his contrition: So in the Abſolution at the beginning of the Service-Book. 3. That it is Authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, as deriving Power and Commiſſion from God, not only to declare the party abſolved, but to abſolve him in words, denoting the firſt Perſon, ſo in this Office for the Viſitation of the Sick; not that the Miniſter can abſolve any whom God abſolves not, or that any ſick Perſon can receive any benefit of abſolution, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the condition of his ſound and ſincere repentance. The power of abſolution is, 1. Abſolute and original, which belongs only to God. <hi>Mark</hi> 2.8. 2.

                     <hi>Verſ. 1.</hi> Lord, all my truſt and confidence is in Thee; I truſt not in any ſecular aid, but depend upon Thee only: Let not my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on Thee be diſappointed and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ. 2.</hi> Thou art the Patron of all, who
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:136233:26"/> are in diſtreſs, and haſt promiſed relief to all, who conſtantly wait on Thee for it; Lord grant me a portion in this thy promiſed mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and let thy faithfulneſs and mercy give me a ſeaſonable deliverance at this time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ. 3.</hi> Be Thou my ſure place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, to which I may reſert in this time of danger, and grant me the performance of that mercy, which Thou haſt promiſed to all, who conſtantly depend upon thee for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ. 4.</hi> Keep me out of the ſnares of the wicked, and let not the enemy of Souls have any advantage over me, nor approach to hurt me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ. 5.</hi> I have ever depended, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied upon Thee, as thy Creature and peculiar Client.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ. 6.</hi> I acknowledge it thy work of continual protection, by which I have been ſupported every hour of my life, and it is of thy primary gift, that I ever had any being in the World, for both which I am obliged continually to bleſs thy Name.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ. 7.</hi> Some carnal Men may wonder to hear me talk of relief from Heaven, who am brought ſo low in the eye of Man; but yet I am not diſheartned at this, I know whom
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:136233:27"/> I truſt, and there is no ſecurity like my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon Thee;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ. 8.</hi> Therefore be pleaſed to ſend me relief, that ſo I may be able to confute thoſe vain Men, and divulge to others the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous advantages of thy ſervice;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ. 9.</hi> Reject me not, O God, now I am in the Wane of my Age, feeble, and deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of strength, for I have none to flie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, but Thee only.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ. 10. and 11.</hi> Refute the obloquies of thoſe, who look upon me as a Perſon forſaken of God, and confute their raſh deſcants upon me, by ſending me a moſt gracious deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ. 12.</hi> Ariſe ſpeedily, O God, to my relief, who have no other dependance but on Thee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ. 13.</hi> So ſhall thoſe vain Perſons be brought to ſhame, by ſeeing themſelves fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and diſappointed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ. 14.</hi> What-ever they talk and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, they ſhall not drive me from my fast and ſure hold, nor from proclaiming to all Men the exceeding goodneſs of that God, on whom I wait. The leſs reaſon they conceive I have ſo to do, ſtill the more will I magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:136233:27"/> thy greatneſs, and profeſs my dependance on Thee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ. 15.</hi> My mouth ſhall number thy faithful and gracious dealings toward me, though I know not the number of them; I will ſpend my whole life in this task, and when I have ſo done, I will confeſs my ſelf to fall far ſhort of giving Thee thy due prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, for thy goodneſs towards thy Servant is infinitely above the imperfect meaſures ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of my valuation or expreſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ. 16.</hi> What-ever I do, or undertake, ſhall not be in any confidence of my own ſtrength, but in a full reliance on thine; I will never talk of any ſecurity, but that which I hold by thy free mercy and fidelity, by which thou art obliged to perform thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and never to forſake thoſe who depend on Thee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ. 17.</hi> Bleſſed God, I have had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of thy wonderful acts of power and goodneſs towards me from the firſt part of mine Age, and I have made declaration of them accordingly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ. 18.</hi> Do not now with-draw from me in my declining Years, wherein I most ſtand in need of thy ſupport, but afford me
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:136233:28"/> matter of continual acknowledgements, that I may proclaim thy attributes to many more than yet I have done, and live to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of bringing in thoſe to thy ſervice, who are not yet born.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ. 19.</hi> How infinitely great, O Lord, is thy bounty? How glorious are thy works of power and goodneſs? There is none, that can in the leaſt be compared with thee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ. 20.</hi> Thou haſt ſuffred me to fall into great afflictions and diſtreſſes, yet I doubt not either of thy pow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ. 22.</hi> For this, and all thy rich mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies will I in most ſolemn manner exalt and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ. 23.</hi> And this ſhall be to me the most joyful imployment in the World, joy to my tongue, being honoured to be the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thy praiſes, joy to my very life being reſcued by thee from ſuch preſent dangers.</p>

                  <hi>Note.</hi> What follows are partly Rules and Directions, how and in what order the Miniſter is to proceed in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Office for the Sick. For Miniſters, who are to bring the People to a Rule, ſhould keep themſelves to an eſtabliſhed Rule, and not go ſome one way, ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. Partly they are comfortable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to be made to the ſick Perſon, in caſe by reaſon of ſome juſt impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the Sacrament cannot be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in that extremity; in ſuch a caſe, the Miniſter is to tell the ſick Perſon, that if he be a ſincere Diſciple of Chriſt, ſo
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:136233:31"/> believing the Doctrin of Chriſt, as to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey it alſo, embracing all his promiſes upon the ſame terms as they are made, not only aſſenting to the truth of them, but undertaking the performance of the conditions of them too; If he tranſcribe <hi>Christ</hi>'s Doctrin and Example, ſo as that both may have an influence upon his life, if he ſincerely and unfeignedly repent of his ſins, and depend upon Chriſt, and him only for ſalvation, reſigning up himſelf wholly to him, This is undoubtedly to eat the fleſh of the Son of Man, and to drink his blood, this is to be a member of Chriſt, and to be intereſted in that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and endleſs life, which Chriſt came to beſtow upon all true believers, and godly livers. He, who departs the world with theſe aſſurances, ſhall receive no prejudice as to his future eſtate, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may ſo happen as to die without receiving the conſecrated Elements of Bread and Wine into his Mouth. For he that believeth in Chriſt, embraceth his doctrin, and is ſincerely his Diſciple, ſhall undoubtedly live for ever. <hi>John</hi> 6.47.</p>

                  <p>IF any ſeducing Teachers have told thee either in their private ſuggeſtions, or popular Sermons, that the Common-Prayer
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:136233:32"/> is nothing but the Maſs-Book tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and that it is <hi>Popiſh</hi> all over, if not worſe; I deſire thee to take notice once for all, that they have told thee as great an untruth as ever was told by any but the Father of Lies; and when thou ſhalt ſee Popery it ſelf clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed out of the Common-Prayer, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire thee to be ſo kind to thy ſelf, as to lend no Ear for the time to come to ſuch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Preachers of Lies; if thou haſt any value at all for thy precious Soul, have nothing to do with theſe precious Seducers, who have found out ſuch a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous policy to delude the vulgar, as to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Doves Eye in the Serpents Head. Now before I proceed to bring forth the Service Book to the Confutation of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, I think it very requiſite, firſt, that it be reſolv'd on, what Popery is not, and then what it is, for I have obſerv'd a very ſtrange humour predominant amongſt ſome more peeviſh <hi>Engliſh</hi> of late time, and that is to brand every thing with the infamous name of Popery, which they like not of; and which is not framed up in every reſpect to pleaſe their fancies,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:136233:32"/> and over-dainty Palats. Sure to read the Book of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> Chapters for Leſſons out of both the Teſtaments, and Epiſtles and Goſpels, is not Popery; now this takes up the greateſt part of our Service-Book; If to read the Bible, and ſo to read it as the Church preſcribes, that is, ſo as to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difie moſt by the reading of it; be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Popery, I profeſs my ſelf ſo much for this Popery, as I could wiſh there were more Papiſts; As for thoſe Apocryphal Chapters we read, I am ſatisfied that the Church enjoyns them to be read only for example of life and inſtruction of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but doth not preſs them to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to eſtabliſh any Doctrine by. <hi>Artic.</hi> 6. The Texts of Scripture ſet before the Service-Book, is not Popery, unleſs the very Scripture be Popery; neither is the following Exhortation, Confeſſion, and Abſolution, the Lord's Prayer, and the following Reſponſes, Popery, for all are grounded upon, and taken Verbatim out of the Scripture. The <hi>Te Deum,</hi> the <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria Patri,</hi> the three Creeds are not Popery, unleſs the Confutation of <hi>Arianiſme,</hi> and other groſs Hereſies of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church

The <hi>Magnificat, Pſalm</hi> the 98th.

The Collect for Peace. The Collect for Grace. The Prayers for the King, for the Royal Family, for the Clergy and People. The Prayer of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom.</hi> The grace of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Collects at Evening Prayer, for peace, for aid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all perils.

To hold the <hi>Pope</hi> Supreme, is taken for grand <hi>Popery,</hi> and the chief hinge on which all other <hi>Popiſh</hi> errours depend: Now the Common-Prayer in all its Collects for the King, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges the King to be Soveraign and Supreme; and in the form for Ordination of Miniſters, the Oath of Supremacy is to be taken by all who enter into holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to acknowledg the Kings Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in all Cauſes, and over all Perſons, as well Eccleſiaſtical as Temporal.

To hold an infallibility, and that the Church cannot erre, is ſaid to be another Branch of <hi>Popery.</hi> By the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-prayer in the firſt general confeſſion
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:136233:34"/> of ſin, we are taught to ſay, <hi>We have erred and ſtrayed from thy ways like loſt Sheep;</hi> and never had we ſo juſt cauſe to ſay it, as ſince we left it off: beſides, that Churches and Councils may err, is plain. <hi>Can.</hi> 19. and <hi>Can.</hi> 21. <hi>Eccleſ. Anglican.</hi> 3. To hold Tranſubſtantiation in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, (a term which many are fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, though they know not what it means) is looked upon by ſome as a very groſs piece of <hi>Popery.</hi> Wheras our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-prayer Book, in the very words wherein the Miniſter delivers the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated Elements to the people, as it holds a real preſence of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Body and Blood in the Sacrament, ſaying, <hi>The Body of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt which was given for thee,</hi> &amp;c. The Blood of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt which was ſhed for thee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So it ſeems to ſhut the Door againſt Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, in ſaying, <hi>Take and eat this in Remembrance,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Drink this in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,</hi> &amp;c. Noting it to be a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration only of his ſuffrings in his natural Body upon the Croſs, however ſpiritually his Body and Blood are both exhibited and participated in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:136233:35"/> Again, our Church is expreſly, both in her Book of Homilies, and in her Articles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Tranſubſtantiation. <hi>Artic.</hi> 28. Indeed the form for adminiſtration in the late Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, did rather officiate towards the errour of Tranſubſtantiation, then the form in our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer-Book. 4. To with-hold the Cup of bleſſing from the People in the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, is looked upon by ſome as a very groſs Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh errour, eſpecially by thoſe who have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther given the Bread nor the Cup to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for many Years together; Now our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer-Book expreſly injoynes the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to give the Communion to the People in both kinds; and our Church is urgent in one of her Articles to have it ſo. <hi>Artic.</hi> 30. <hi>Eccleſ. Ang.</hi> 5. To reſtrain the holy Scriptures from the peruſal of the People is branded for <hi>Popery,</hi> and that by ſome who have indulged ſo great a liberty to the People in this kind, that they have abuſed and wreſted the Scriptures to patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize Treaſon, Rebellion, Sacriledge, and any groſs ſin whatſoever. Now in our Common-Prayer-Book, that Scripture which is moſt for edification, is not only ordered to be read in the vulgar tongue, but ſo ordered to be read, and ſo ſorted out to all the beſt advantages, that would the People follow the Churches or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and method, it is not poſſible they ſhould be ſo groſly ignorant as they are. 6. To have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayers in a Tongue unknown to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People, and to which they cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandingly
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:136233:35"/> ſay, <hi>Amen,</hi> is condemned for grand <hi>Popery,</hi> by thoſe who yet have deviſed a way of extemporary Prayer, and many times in ſuch language too, that it is not poſſible for People ſafely to joyn their <hi>Amen</hi> to thoſe Prayers, which they cannot underſtand; But the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer ſums up all lawful and neceſſary requeſts, in ſo plain and pious formes, that they may ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to, and edifie by thoſe Prayers, if they will. 7. To prohibit Marriage to Men in Holy Orders, is voted grand <hi>Popery,</hi> eſpecially by thoſe who have ſo much invaded the Church-maintenance, that there is ſcarce ſufficient left to maintain the Miniſters in a ſingle life; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as our Common-prayer-Book in the Office for Matrimony, admits all to the holy ſtate of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, that are allowed of by the Word of God; and the Church of <hi>England</hi> expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares the marriage of Prieſts to be lawful. <hi>Artic.</hi> 32. 8. To indulge Marriage to Perſons within the degrees prohibited by the Laws of God, is accounted another branch of <hi>Popery;</hi> But the Common-prayer-Book in the Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Office, declares againſt it; and ſo doth the Church. <hi>Can.</hi> 99. 9. To tolerate the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Divorce betwixt Man and Wife, for more cauſes than the cauſe of Fornication; is accounted <hi>Popery,</hi> and yet they did both allow it, and practiſe it, who profeſs themſelves to be the only Anti-Papiſts. The Common-prayer now in the Matrimonial Office admits of no ſuch thing; and our Church is very cautious
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:136233:36"/> in ſo weighty a matter. <hi>Can.</hi> 105, 106, 107. 10. To obtrude new Articles of faith upon the People, which have no ground in the Word of God, is complain'd of for very groſs <hi>Popery;</hi> eſpecially by thoſe who have of late years done it, thruſting upon the People new Doctrines, new Catechiſms, new Covenants, which are in many things contrariant to God's Word, and did it with ſuch violence, as to refuſe them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, who refuſed to ſubmit to theſe impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions. Whereas our Common Prayer-Book admits of no more Articles of faith than what are contained in the ancient Creeds of the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Church. And the Church expreſly declares for them. <hi>Artic.</hi> 8. and as expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares againſt any thing enforced as a matter of faith, which is contrary to Gods written word. <hi>Artic.</hi> 6. <hi>Artic.</hi> 20. <hi>Artic.</hi> 21. 11. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine concerning Purgatory, Pardons, worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and adoration, as well of images, as of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, and alſo invocation of Saints; is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed againſt as very foul and intolerable <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery;</hi> by thoſe eſpecially, who made of late Years Mens lives more bitter then any <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory;</hi> who drew People off from their ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and allegiance to their lawful Prince, and pardon'd them when they had done; who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced all Images, which were only for decency, and a civil remembrance, with that zeal and fury as if they ſaw ſome Religion in them more then ever was intended; and who were ſo far from the invocation of Saints, that they ran fouly
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:136233:36"/> into the other extreme, obliterating all their annual days of obſervance, and inſtead of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them any pious and civil remembrance, ſordidly reviling them, and diſgracing ſo much as in them lay their very memories and names. However the Common-prayer-Book, and our Church teacheth them no <hi>Popery,</hi> yet both may teach them more civility and moderation. As for a <hi>Popiſh</hi> purgatory the Common-prayer is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it in the Burial Office, holding the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of all, who depart hence in the Lord, to be in joy and felicity: in bliſs, though not in their perfect conſummation and bliſs. As for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons and indulgencies, the Common-prayer takes notice of none, but only while Men are alive to beg for pardon, and that of God, not for the merit of any Saint, but for the merits of Chriſt, for moſt of the Collects conclude, <hi>Through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> For worſhiping and adoration of Images, there is not one ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable in all the Common-prayer tending that way, but through all the Offices our worſhip and adoration is terminated in God as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per object, and offred by Chriſt as the only Advocate, Mediator and Interceſſor. And for invocation of Saints departed, or praying to them, there is no thing ſo irreconcilable to our Common-prayer-Book: For, through all the Offices of it, we acknowledg no Mediator, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſor, or Advocate but <hi>Chriſt</hi> only, indeed we honor the memorial of ſome known Scripture Saints, by obſerving ſet days, and propounding

                        <hi>Verſ. 3.</hi> Thou art the great and moſt juſt Diſpoſer of all events, when thy Creatures fall off, and make defection from thee; it is juſt with thee to puniſh them for their ſins, and to return them back to the Earth from whence by thy Creative Power they were at firſt produced; This was the Sentence paſſed upon <hi>Adam,</hi> and according to the ſame art thou now pleaſed to deal with many of us.</p>

                        <hi>Verſ. 5.</hi> As for us Men, we are frail and ſhort-liv'd, our whole Age is quickly at an end, by the courſe of Nature; but when thy wrath breaks forth upon us, then death
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:136233:49"/> comes as a torrent, and ſweeps us away in the midſt of our ſtrength; our life is then but as a dream when one awakes out of ſleep, a phanſie at first, and that ſoon vaniſh'd; whilſt we live we do but ſeem to live, death comes and the phanſy of life vaniſheth.</p>

                        <hi>Verſ. 7.</hi> For by reaſon of our ſins thou art provoked to cut us off in the prime and moſt flouriſhing part of our Age.</p>

                        <hi>Verſ. 8.</hi> Our open and crying ſins thou thinkeſt fit thus to puniſh with exciſion; and beſides there are many ſecret ſins unknown to Men, but not unknown to Thee, which alſo provoke thy wrath, and call forth thy ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance againſt us, ſuch are our Apostaſies, turnings back, diſlike of thy Methods in the guiding and governing of us, preferring the ſatisfaction of our own luſts before an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diential
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:136233:49"/> ſubmiſſion to thy Commands; and for ſuch ſins as theſe are we ſwept away and conſumed in a viſible formidable manner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Verſ. 9.</hi> By reaſon of our provocations thy diſpleaſure is gone out againſt us, ſo that our Years are ſuddenly cut off, ſooner then one can ſpeak, and that is as ſoon as one can think, like the Spider, we weave ſuch Webs as the next Broom ſweeps away, our Age is ſpent in fruitleſs labours, which preſently come to nothing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Verſ. 10.</hi> Thy Oath being gone out to cut ſhort our time here for our impieties, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of us die before we can advance to more than the ſeventieth Year of our Age; few live up to eighty, and they who live be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it, have little joy in their life, being combred with weakneſs, wearineſs, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes; ſo that our Age is nothing in reſpect of true duration, it being but a thought or breath.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Verſ. 11.</hi> Whilst thus we are daily cut off, the great unhappineſs of it, is, that no Man is careful to lay to heart theſe terrible effects of God's wrath upon us; no Man is ſo far inſtructed by what he ſees daily befall others, as to be ſenſible of his own danger,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:136233:50"/> and the ſhortneſs of his life, ſo as to live well whilſt he is permitted to live.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Verſ. 12.</hi> But (O Lord) be thou pleaſed to give us this grace, ſo to inſtruct us, and convince us of the ſhortneſs of our lives, that we may by this conſideration be brought to pay that conſtant reverence and obedience which is due to Thee, and wherein the true wiſdom conſiſts; for there cannot be any greater folly imaginable, than to provoke Thee by our ſins, and to run the adventure of being cut off by Thee in our ſins.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Verſ. 13.</hi> And (O Lord,) if it ſtand with thy good pleaſure, reverſe the ſentence of exciſion, which is gone out againſt us, let it ſuffice that thy wrath hath ſwept away ſo many of us, vouchſafe, at laſt to be pacified, and reconciled with us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Verſ. 14.</hi> We have lain very long under thy wrath, delay not now to afford us the full streams of thy mercy, which we have ſo long wanted, and impatiently thirſted after; that ſo for the remainder of our time we may have ſome matter of rejoycing after ſo much ſadneſs.</p>

All the hope of a Chriſtian is not terminated with this life of his here on Earth, for if it were ſo, Chriſtians would be the moſt unhappy Perſons, and the moſt proper objects of compaſſion in the World. But bleſſed be God for it, it is much otherwiſe; for Chriſt is riſen, and he by raiſing himſelf raiſeth all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with him, as in the conſecration of the firſt fruits the whole Harveſt is alſo conſecrate: So that we Chriſtians, who are miſerable here, ſhall be rewarded hereafter; for Chriſt's Reſurrection is a moſt certain proof of ours. As the Head muſt riſe before the Members, ſo the Members are ſure to follow the Head.</p>

                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 21. As one Man brought death into the World, ſo another Man brought Reſurrection into the World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 22. For as upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, All, who are partakers of his nature, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded under the ſentence of his death; ſo all regenerate believers, who are like to Chriſt, and belong to him, ſhall be raiſed to immortal life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 23. But yet with ſome diſtance of Time ſhall this be, Chriſt the firſt fruits ſhall riſe ſome time before, and all regenerate Chriſtians ſhall riſe after Him at his laſt coming to Judgment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 24. And then at the Concluſion of this World, and of the ſpiritual King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt in the Church here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, he ſhall deliver up all his power ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed by Himſelf, and his Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers into the hand of God his Father, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt deſtroyed all earthly Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, pronouncing ſentence upon the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt, as well as the meaneſt Men, ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:136233:52"/> all to his Power, either by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, or their deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 25. For this was the promiſe, which was made to Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. that his Spiritual Kingdom on Earth ſhould laſt ſo long till God had brought all the World to be ſubject to Him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 26. The laſt Enemy to be ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him is death, and that muſt be therefore ſubdued, that Men may be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed again from death to life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 27. The evidence is clear, that God will ſubdue all enemies and things without exception under Chriſt, only God is excepted from being ſo ſubdued, from whom Chriſt hath received this power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 28. And when all things ſhall thus be brought in ſubjection to Chriſt, then ſhall Chriſt lay down that Office, which til then he exerciſeth, and in which he is conſpicuous in his Church. And then ſhal God Father, Son, &amp; Holy Ghoſt fill all the Elect with endleſs Bliſs and Glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 29. Now if the dead riſe not, why do Men at their Baptiſm make profeſſion
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:136233:52"/> of the belief of it? for the Reſurrection of the dead is one of the prime Articles of belief, into which Chriſtians are Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and to which Baptiſm refers, as a ſignificant emblem firſt of Chriſts, then of our Reſurrection from the Grave; The putting in, and taking out of the Water, being a ſign of deſcending into the ſtate of the dead, and aſcending from thence. To be a Baptized Chriſtian, and not to believe the Reſurrection is a ridiculous thing, an Hypocriſie which will never be anſwer'd to God or men.</p>

                     </gap>, after the manner of Men, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies this, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſo far as Man's pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe extended concerning him, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to this death of fighting with Beaſts at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> only God by a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful providence delivered him from it. Now it had been very ſtrange, ſhould the Apoſtle have expoſed himſelf to ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent danger of death, as Men led on by nothing but that which is humane, ſuch as vain glory, and ſome other reſpect, have done, had not he by faith looked at a Reſurrection, and at God the Reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of thoſe who ſuffer for him, at that Day.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 33. <hi>But have a care that ye be not ſeduced by any Philoſophical, or debauched Diſcourſes to disbelieve the Reſurrection; Take heed that ſuch Atheiſtical temptations to ſenſuality, under pretence of no other life after this, do not work upon you; and the rather, becauſe good natures, and the moſt flexible diſpoſitions are the ſooneſt cheated, and deceived, by ſuch corrupt converſe, and fooliſh diſpute.</hi>

                  <p>Verſ. 34. <hi>Ye have all the Reaſon in the World, and now it is more than time that ye ſhould rouſe up your ſelves out of the drouzy condition of ſin, which ye have been in for a long time, in ſo much that ſome of you by your behaviour and diſcourſe ſhow your ſelvs to be very Atheiſts ſtil, and meer Heathens; of whom I am forced to ſpeak, only to work ſhame in you for ſuffering ſuch Men among you, and that ye may not permit your ſelves to be tempted by them into ſuch Errours and Debaucheries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 35. <hi>But ſome perhaps may object, that if Men die, How can they live again? or what kind of Body ſhall they have, ſeeing that which they had is rotten in the Grave?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 36. <hi>But this is a fooliſh Objection, for even in Corn that is ſowed, the rotting of the Corn is neceſſary to the enlivening of it, or ſpringing of it up again.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 37. <hi>And it is not the cuſtom to ſow that very thing which after comes up, the Blade, and Ear, and Corn in it, but only the Corn without the reſt, as the Corn of Wheat, and the like.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 38. <hi>And whenſoever ſuch a ſingle Grain is ſown in the Earth without any Ear
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:136233:56"/> or Chaff about it, God cauſeth it to grow up out of the Earth in this or that forme, with Root, and Blades, and Ears of Wheat, and of all other Seeds proportionably according to their kind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 39. <hi>And as amongst us here below one ſort of fleſh differs very much from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo the Bodies of Men here differ in their qualities from the glorified Bodies in Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 40. <hi>For it is to be obſerved that in the Reſurrection, there ſhall be,</hi> 1. <hi>An im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of all Mens eſtates, who have their part in the Reſurrection of the juſt, above that which they here enjoy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 41. 2. <hi>There ſhall be degrees of glory of one above another; as Heavenly Bodies are more glorious than Earthly, and one Heavenly Body more glorious than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo ſhall it be in the Reſurrection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 42. <hi>For it is to be noted, which is indeed the chief thing notable in this preſent Diſcourſe, that the Bodies, which ſhall riſe, differ from thoſe that die, and the state of the Reſurrection differs from that of this life. That, which falls into the Grave is a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Body, that, which ſhall riſe again an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:136233:57"/>
                  <p>Verſ. 43. <hi>The Body which we live in here, and muſt put off, is ſubject to many diſhonorable deformities, weakneſses, diſeaſes, age; but the Body, which we ſhall take up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and put on, ſhall be a Body glorious and ſtrong.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 44. <hi>The Body we carry about with us while we live, and lay down in the Grave, when we die, is nouriſhed and ſuſtained by meats and drinks; whereas the Body in our future ſtate will be immortal, wanting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſuſtain it. For indeed ſuch Bodies there are of both theſe ſorts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 45. <hi>For thus we find it written in the Scriptures, that we have one nature from Adam, ſuch a Body as Adam is mention'd to have had before his fall,</hi> Gen. 2.7. <hi>we derive from him, who communicated it to his Poſterity. But another Nature, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Body we ſhall receive from Chriſt, who at the Reſurrection ſhall reſtore us from the Grave, and change our vile Bodies, that they may be like unto His glorious Body.</hi> Phil. 3.21.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 46. <hi>The mortal Body was first for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, which needed ſuſtenance, without which it muſt needs periſh; and when this is put off
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:136233:57"/> by death, the immortal Body ſhall be return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us inſtead of it at the Reſurrection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 47. The ſtock of our animal life was <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo called, as an earthy Man made, and taken out of the Earth. The ſtock of the life immortal is Chriſt the Lord, who came down from Heaven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 48. Such a Body as <hi>Adam</hi> had, ſuch have all mortal Men; and ſuch a Body as Chriſt now hath ſhall we have, who live according to his Precept and Example at the Reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 49. As we have firſt been made like the mortal <hi>Adam</hi> here on Earth; ſo we ſhall be made like the immortal Chriſt, when we come to Heaven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 50. I ſhall add but this one thing more, that it is not poſſible for theſe ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, corruptible, weak, ignominious Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of ours, which are in a ſtate of grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and feeding, to come to Heaven; but they muſt firſt be changed, purified, and immortaliz'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 51. Therefore concerning thoſe, who ſhall be found alive at the Day of Judgment; I ſhall tell you a Secret not yet diſcovered to you, that though they
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:136233:58"/> die not at all, yet they ſhall all be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged before they go to Heaven, for theſe Bodies thus qualified as they now are cannot come thither.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 52. And this change ſhall be wrought in a minute, at the point of time, when all the World ſhall be ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to Judgment. For God ſhall make the Angels alarm all the World of Men that ever was or ſhall be, as by the ſound of a Trumpet to appear before his Tribunal; and when that alarme is given all, that were formerly dead, ſhall ariſe with immortal Bodies, and they, who ſhall be then alive, ſhall from their mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Bodies be changed into ſuch.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 53. For it is moſt certain and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that our mortal Bodies muſt be changed into immortal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 54. And when this is done, then ſhall that ſaying of the Prophet be made good, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14. that death ſhall be devoured and deſtroyed for ever, never to recover ſtrength again over any thing, nothing from thenceforth ſhall ever die.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 55. In contemplation whereof, a Chriſtian may look upon death as a hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:136233:58"/> thing, the ſting, or plague, or wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power of it being by Chriſt taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; and look upon the ſtate of ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Soul from Body, to be ſuch as ſhall not laſt for ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 56. The only thing, which makes Death ſting like a Serpent, and puts it in a capacity to hurt us, is ſin; for were it not for ſin, Death would differ nothing from a calm ſleep; and that which gives ſin any ſtrength to miſchief us, is the Law, which prohibits it, and ſo conſequently upon the breach brings guilt upon us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 57. But thanks be to God, who by what Chriſt hath done for us, hath given us victory over Sin and Death, and by Conqueſt of Sin hath made Death but an Entrance to Immortality.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 58. Theſe Arguments may ſuffice to teach any Chriſtian conſtancy and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance in doing Gods will, and in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Gods will too; and may oblige him to the utmoſt induſtry and diligence in the ſervice of God, knowing that nothing, which we thus undergo, ſhall fail of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a reward.</p>

                  <p>Man that is born of a Woman, hath but a ſhort time to live, and is full of miſery; he cometh up, and is cut down like a flower; he fleeth as it were a ſhadow, and never conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth in one ſtay.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>That is,</hi> Man is born of a Woman and as he hath received being from her, ſo he hath derived weakneſs; he lives here few Years, but in ſo ſhort a time he ſuffers many miſeries. He is born like a flower, and paſſeth away like it; he is like the ſhadow of our Quadrants in a perpetual motion, and change is ſo far paſſed into
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:136233:59"/> his nature, that notwithſtanding all his endeavours, he cannot remain one ſole moment in the ſame condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note here.</hi> That the ſticking of the Herſe with Flowers, and the uſe of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands at ſuch a time, is a cuſtom which hath ſome reſemblance with the <hi>Jews,</hi> who, as they went along by the Corps, uſed to pluck up the Graſs. 1. To note the ſhortneſs of Man's life, that Man is but as Graſs, as the flower of the Field: It was ſaid of a great Emperour, that he was <hi>Parietira,</hi> a wall-flower; and ſo are we all; our time is proclaimed, <hi>Iſay</hi> 40.6. withering ſooner than the Graſs, which is ſhort, fading ſooner than the flower of the Graſs which is ſhorter. From <hi>April</hi> to <hi>June;</hi> the Sith cometh, nay, the Wind but bloweth, and we are gone. <hi>Hodie in agro, cras in clibano.</hi> Flouriſhing in the Morning, fading, cut down, and withered before Night. 2. To note the certain hopes of a Reſurrection. Such Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are uſed in exprobration to Death and Mortality. By them we ſhew that we are not ſorry for our departed friends, as Men without hope; we look upon them
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:136233:60"/> only as Herbs and Flowers cropt off for a time, and to ſpring up again in their ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. We ſow their Bodies in the Earth with as much faith as we do our Seeds, and Herbs; and equally expect the ſpring of both.</p>

So there is a two-fold death; The firſt death to which the firſt nature, which we derive from <hi>Adam,</hi> is ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; For upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, all that are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his nature, are concluded under the ſentence of death pronounced againſt him. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22.

                  <hi>Note,</hi> I may ſay of the Lord's Prayer; only peruſe it, commend it I need not, for the Author's worth is ſo well known, that he needeth not any Man's commendation, nay he is above all commendation; and the work it ſelf is ſo perfect and compleat, containing ſo much in ſo little, ſo ſhort in words, ſo large in matter; that it needs not any commendation neither. 'Tis the Lord's Prayer dictated by our Saviour himſelf in the behalf of his Diſciples, and his Church, to the end of the World. He to whom we pray, and in whoſe Name we pray, hath left us this pattern to be <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma &amp; Norma Orationis.</hi> It deſerves a very high reſpect for the Author's ſake. He compos'd it, who is <hi>Dei ſpiritus, &amp; Dei Sermo, &amp; Dei ratio; Sermo rationis, &amp; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio Sermonis &amp; Spiritus. Tertul. de Orat. lib.</hi> 'Tis ſhort, but withall plain, 'tis few in words, but withall full in matter, like the beſt Coin it contains the moſt value in the ſmalleſt compaſs. Theſe reaſons may be given for the ſhortneſs of it. 1. That it may be the ſooner learnt. 2. That it
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:136233:69"/> may be the better retained in memory. 3. That it may be the oftner uſed. 4. That there may be no wearineſs in the ſaying of it. 5. That there may be no excuſe for the not knowing of it. 6. That it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get in us a confidence of ſoon obtaining what we pray for. 7. To ſhew that the Efficacy of Prayer conſiſts not in how much, but how well, not in the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of words, but in the devotion of the heart. And for this purpoſe hath our Church, in imitation of this pattern, fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up all her Prayers in ſhort Collects, like many Flowers gathered into little Bundles. We know the hotteſt Springs ſend forth their Waters by ebullitions, and doubtleſs the moſt zealous hearts ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their conceits in the feweſt words, and ſhorteſt formes; in all the Bible we read not any Examples of very long Prayers: Our Saviours Prayer in the Garden, ſhort; our Saviours Pray'r upon the Croſs ſhort; <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Pray'r for his Perſecutors ſhort. The <hi>Publicans</hi> Prayer ſhort; The Thief's Prayer upon the Croſs ſhort. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Prayers all ſhort; They, who did Petition our Saviour in the Goſpel, did it
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:136233:69"/> in ſhort forms. So in the New Teſtament, and ſo in the Old. <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms, which are moſt of them Prayers or Praiſes, not very long; <hi>Solomon</hi> commends few words in the Old Teſtament, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.2. and a greater than <hi>Solomon</hi> condemns long Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the New, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.14. if not the Prayers, yet I am ſure the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie of them he doth condemn. As the Scriptures, ſo the Fathers in all their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings are for ſhort Prayers. <hi>Hoc negotium plus gemitibus quam ſermonibus agitur, plus ſletu quam afflatu. Auguſt. Epiſt.</hi> 121. <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio brevis penetrat Coelum. Auguſtine</hi> alſo tells us, that it was the practiſe of all the Chriſtians in <hi>Aegypt</hi> to uſe ſhort Prayers, and he gives the Reaſon for their ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Dicuntur fratres in Aegypto crebras quidem habere orationes, ſed eas quidem bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſſimas, &amp; raptim quodam modo ejaculatas, ne illa vigilanter erecta, quae Orationi plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimum neceſſaria eſt, per productiores mores evaneſcat, atque hebetetur intentio. August. Epiſt.</hi> 121. But I ſay no more upon this Argument, the ſhorter our Prayers are, the neerer they are to the pattern of our Saviour, who, when he taught his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:136233:70"/> to pray, preſcribed them a ſhort forme; and the Reverend Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> in his Pray'rs after Sermon ſwerved not from this Rule, obſerving ever both a ſet, and ſhort forme. See his Bidding of Prayer uſed at the end of his Sermons upon <hi>Job.</hi> Again, the Prayer of our Saviour, as it is ſhort, ſo it is moſt excellent in the uſe, being ſo fram'd, that it may ſuit for all Times, Perſons, Places and Conditions; other Prayers may be at ſome times un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable, this never; it is not only <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Orationis,</hi> a Rule to pray by, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.9. but it is <hi>Forma Orationis,</hi> a Form to pray in, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.2. As <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples had a Form, which none uſed but themſelves, by which they were known to be his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.1. So <hi>Chriſt</hi> gave his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples a Form, which <hi>Tertullian</hi> terms <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationem Legitimam;</hi> a Prayer, which <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s own Law hath tied his Church to uſe in the ſame form of words, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he deliver'd it; and ever hath it been uſed in all parts of the World, where Chriſtian Religion ever was.

Therefore if we may believe St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> as a witneſs of Antiquity, the Univerſal Church of Chriſt hath ever uſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin and end all her Prayers with this form; as ſtriving indeed by divers other formes more largely to expreſs the ſenſe of this, but being not able to come neer to the high note, and moſt excellent ſpirit of perfection in this, they ever concluded with it, as being aſſur'd that however they may for divers defects not attain to the depth of it, yet by it they ſhall be ſure to beg all things neceſſary at Gods hands.

                  <p>IN the firſt place, I am to deſire thee to have ſo much charity for our revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Mother the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as not to think her any way addicted to an affected ſingularity in her preſcribed Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the Burial of her dying Children, for as in her other Offices, ſo in this ſhe holds exact conformity with her other Siſters, the Reformed Churches beyond the Seas, ſo far as they may be permitted to hold conformity with her. <hi>Vid.</hi> Mr. <hi>Durel.</hi> Touching the conformity of other reformed Churches with the Reformed

Eccleſ. Pol. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>ſect.</hi> 75. Some few Rites more I ſhall add obſerved at Funerals, together with their Reaſons annexed, only to give ſatisfaction to thoſe better ſort of weak Chriſtians, who quarrel at their uſe more out of tenderneſs of conſcience, than out of turbulency or any contentious ſpirit; as for ſuch, who are contentiouſly given, who are ill-willers to Sion, who are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the peace of the Church, who delight in nothing but dreadful confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and make it a great part of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to quarrel the ancient practiſes of the Church, and juſt Orders of Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, I leave them to the ſevereſt execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Laws of the Land, and the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:136233:75"/> power of thoſe who are inveſted with Juriſdiction to puniſh them as ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, and ſeditious Perſons, and as the nature of their offence ſhall deſerve; and truly I think Superiours may be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for their indulgence in ſuch caſes, as well as for their ſeverity; Our Church will never be at peace, and our State ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at quiet from the working of ſome Mens ſpirits, and intemperate zeal, <hi>Si vitiis Principum iraſci liceat, &amp; inſidiari bonitati:</hi> But enough of this, I proceed now to ſpeak of the few other Rites ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther practiſed at Funerals than by Law or Canon preſcribed, and to account for them with what brevity and perſpicuity I can: 1. The ringing of the Paſſing-bel, or Soul-bell, as we call it, is not intended to help the paſſage of the Soul when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of the Body, but only to ſtir up devout Chriſtians to pray for its hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py paſſage out of its Body, and to move thoſe who are living to make reflexions upon their own mortality, and ſeriouſly to conſider of their later end. This Bell is like St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Trumpet, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.8. which gives ſuch a certain ſound, that all
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:136233:75"/> within the hearing of it may prepare themſelves to the Battel, which is to be fought in the Field of Death. 2. It was an ancient cuſtom, and is ſtill practiſed, to bury the Dead with their Faces turning towards the Eaſt, to ſhew that they were as ſure of an upriſe, as the Sun that comes forth of his Eaſtern Chamber, and that they lie waiting for that Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, <hi>Malach.</hi> 4.2. who ſhall at the laſt day return with his healing Wings, and quicken and revive all the dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of his Servants by his healing and life-giving influence, when he comes with his <hi>Prodi Lazare;</hi> or <hi>Surge qui dormis;</hi> then the Graves ſhall ſet open their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Doors, and reſtore their <hi>depoſita.</hi> When the Arch-Angel ſhall ſound the Trump of Collection, then the ſcattered bones of Gods Saints ſhall be gathered together with ſinews, and thoſe ſinews incorporated with fleſh, and that fleſh covered over with skin (all mortality, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purged away) and by a new <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> (or rather <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> never dreamed of) the ſame Soul ſhall re-enter the ſame Body; Theſe and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:136233:76"/> the like Ceremonies the Church hath practiſed in her Funerals, to be as <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſo many ſignificant em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems to ſtrengthen and confirm her li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Children in the hopes of a joyful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. 3. It was an ancient cuſtom after Burial, to go to the holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, unleſs the Office were performed after Noon; for then, if Men were not faſting, it was done only with Prayers: <hi>Concil. Carthag.</hi> 3. <hi>Can.</hi> 29. <hi>Vid.</hi> Doctor <hi>Sparrow, Rational. pag.</hi> 355. and the Book of Canons and Conſtitutions Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical ſet forth by him. 4. Funeral Doles were an ancient cuſtom. <hi>Chryſoſt. Homil.</hi> 32. in <hi>Matth.</hi> But as concerning them, the right uſe, and the abuſe, Vid. <hi>Haman L'eſtrange</hi> in his alliance of Divine Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in his account given of the Burial Office. 5. The cuſtom of Funeral Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and Orations may ſeem to be firſt derived from the <hi>Jews</hi> and Heathens. For it was a cuſtom amongſt the Heathens, <hi>Laudare defunctum pro roſtris. Sueton. Jul. Caeſar. c.</hi> 6. And touching the <hi>Jews,</hi> we find it practiſed by King <hi>David.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. And from both Chriſtians may have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:136233:76"/> this cuſtome, making it ſerve for theſe purpoſes. 1. To make thoſe, who are alive, more careful how they live, when they know their departure ſhall not be folded up in ſilence: 2. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm Mens hopes againſt the time of their own diſſolution, and to mind them, 1. Of their timely preparation for death. 2. Of their eſtate after death. 3. Of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, but chiefly of the <hi>Quatuor No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſſima,</hi> Death, Judgment, Heaven, Hell; that ſo all may bring us (if poſſible) to holy living, which is the ſureſt preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to happy dying; that by every ſuch occaſion we may learn ſomething to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter us in our ſpiritual eſtate, and not only wiſh with <hi>Balaam</hi> to die the death of the righteous, but according to the Apoſtles advice, ſtrive to live their lives, treading ſo near as we can in the ſteps of their moſt holy faith, conſidering the end of their converſation. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7. For my part, I cannot ſpeak much in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of this, among ſome over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much magnified cuſtom, only it is a good help to mend the Miniſters maintenance where it is (as it is in too many places)
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:136233:77"/> very ſcandalouſly ſmall; I hope thoſe, who are now in place to do it, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of it, and by their prudent care en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the too penurious proportions, for if this courſe was taken, I am very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it would give abundant ſatisfaction to the People, and undoubtedly be a great incouragement to the inferiour Miniſtry to lay aſide their <hi>Placentia,</hi> and to preach that doctrin which may be leſs pleaſing, but more profitable, when they receive any aſſurance from an eſtabliſhed Law, that their maintenance is legally due, and not altogether depending upon the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie and uncertain benevolence of the People. But indeed in Funeral Sermons there hath been obſerved too much of the mode and gallantry, too much of applauſe and flattery, too much of popularity and vanity, Encomiums and Elogies have been given, where none due; The vile Perſon hath been called liberal, and the Churl bountiful, <hi>Iſay</hi> 32.5. By ſome Paraſitical Preachers; an abſurdity better befitting the Stage, than the Pulpit, yet neither place well, for both <hi>Comoedia</hi> and <hi>Concio</hi> ſhould be <hi>Vitae Speculum:</hi> Now in regard
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:136233:77"/> Funeral Sermons are ſo much in faſhion, indeed preaching for the moſt part is now but faſhionable, as it was in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s time. <hi>Chap.</hi> 33. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 30, 31, 32, 33.

               </q> The INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>FUneral Sermons are ordinary Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes made over the dead, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the benefit of the living, and Funeral Offices, that is, ſet forms of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial to be read over the dead at the Grave, have the like holy end, &amp; deſign in them;
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:136233:78"/> Both are to mind us of the laſt things, which we cannot eſcape, and yet are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to forget, till ſuch like ocular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations as theſe bring them freſh to our remembrance. Death, Judgment, Heaven, and Hell: He, that would make theſe four his <hi>Vade mecum,</hi> and ſeriouſly conſider of them all his life time, would rarely do amiſs. Were theſe as carefully laid up in our hearts, as they are cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily by preaching poured into our ears, certainly they would have a more refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming influence upon our lives than moſt what they have; How ſhould we be leſs proud, and more humble? How ſhould we loath ſin, and love ſanctity? How ſhould we prize Heaven, and ſet all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Heaven at nought? How evenly ſhould we carry our ſelves betwixt both the Tables of Piety, and Juſtice, of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and charity, towards God and our Neighbour, Superiors, Inferiours, Equals? How careful ſhould we be not to omit any duty? How fearful ſhould we be to commit any ſin? How piouſly ſhould we live as to God-ward, how righteouſly as to Man-ward, how ſoberly as to our ſelvs,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:136233:78"/> did we ſeriouſly reſolve to practiſe what we hear, as we cuſtomarily come upon ſuch like occaſions to hear what we ſhould practiſe; or would we but carry away the Text, when perhaps much of the Sermon, like the good Seed in the Goſpel, may be catched up by the Birds of the Air, wandring thoughts, or choaked by thorns, the cares of the World; yet did we but carry this Text home with us, and ſeriouſly meditate upon it, when we come at home, it might with God's bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing do a great part of the work every Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſhould be deſigned for; and that is, not to make us wiſer, but to make us bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not to inform our Judgments, but to reform our lives, and to ſettle us upon ſuch a bottom, as not to dare to live in that ſtate of life, wherein I am ſure we ſhould not willingly dare to die, a ſtate of ſin, a ſtate of impenitency, a ſtate of hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart. Certainly no Man willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would have death find him in ſuch a ſtate as this, eſpecially conſidering, that death is not the <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:136233:79"/> to eternal bliſs, if we live in God's fear, and die in God's favour, or to a miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able eternity, if we live and die other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. For, <hi>as it is appointed,</hi> &amp;c. The meaning of the words is ſo obvious, that they need no explication. <hi>Deſiderant po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius pium auditorem, quam curioſum expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torem.</hi> They require rather a conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous application, than an explication of curioſity. The words are plain; It is the condition of all Men, to die, and to die but once, and then to be judged to all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity; Here's enough for explication, any one may ſee into the meaning of the Text, who will not be wilfully blind; I, but now for the application; if this be the ſtate, if this be the condition of all Men, firſt to be under the arreſt of death, and then to be arraigned at the Bar,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.32.</note> and brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judge; will not this make our hearts burn within us? warm our affections, and beget in us a zeal to godly living more than ordinary? Nay, will not this prick us at the heart, as <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sermon did, and work com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction upon our Spirits? Will it not
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:136233:79"/> bring the guilt of our ſins to our Remembrance,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19.</note> and make us, as the <hi>Jews</hi> once did, paſſionately ſue to thoſe Miniſters to whom Chriſt hath committed the word of reconciliation, that they would adminiſter a ſeaſonable word of comfort to us, and give us dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions what to do in ſuch a caſe as this. I know the Scripture Rule is, <hi>Is any ſick among you, let him call for the Elders of the Church:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 5.14.</note> That is, ſeek out to ſome ſpiritual Perſon, who is over the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, that he may contribute his aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, afford the ſick man his beſt directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, pray to God with him and for him, that God would pardon his ſins, aſſwage his pain, remove the diſeaſe, reſtore him to his former health, and the like; this being a duty injoyned, would not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Better then in time of ſickneſs, than not at all; but better in time of health, I think, than in time of ſickneſs. In the midſt of life we are in death, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the midſt of life we ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for death; whether ſick or well, that
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:136233:80"/> meſſage to <hi>Hezekiah</hi> concerns us all. <hi>Set thine houſe in order,</hi> Iſay 38.1. There is a time when all Men will be glad to ſeek God, and that is <hi>Cum occiderit,</hi> when he lays any ſcourge or ſickneſs upon us; when he ſlew them then they ſought him, and turned them early, and enquired after God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.34. Even they, who kept not the Covenant of God before. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 10. who forgot his works. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11. who ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, provoked him, tempted him in their heart, and ſpake againſt him, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 17, 18, 19. who neither believed in him, nor tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in his ſalvation, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 22. but ſpent their Days in vanity, and their Years in turmoil in the World, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 33. never thinking upon God at all, in a pinch of danger and extremity, when he ſlew them, did all turn ſeekers, to find help from the ſame hand, which hurt and wounded them. This is the very Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts time, and the time of the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched Perſon in the World to ſeek God in, this is the time which brought home the Prodigal; they who looſe him in time of health, will be glad to ſeek, and ſue to him in time of ſickneſs. Therefore
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:136233:80"/> let me recommend to you another time, when ye will be more certain and ſure to find him, becauſe it is God's acceptable time, and that is in time of health, when your Mountain is ſtrong, your Hedge and Fence about you ſafe and untoucht; when you have other dependencies, yet then to ſlight them all, and to depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, that's the time, which pleaſes him. Now, now ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> in the days of thy youth, in thy proſperity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the evil days come, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Remember now thy Creatour;</hi> However our memory is placed in the hinder part of the Head, yet we muſt not defer our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring to the hindermoſt part of our Life. I know it is the deſire of all Men, when they are going out of the World, to have a ſecure Paſsport, and to get as much an aſſurance of their happineſs and future eſtate as can be; Now give me leave to be plain with you, I can give you no better aſſurance then what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture affords, God's word is the beſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. If ye look for an aſſurance of faith, Faith is but the ſubſtance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:136233:81"/> ſeen. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. If ye look for an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of hope. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.11. Hope carries us to that which is within the Vail, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.19. which we hope for, but cannot ſee; if ye look for an aſſurance in that which we call Election, I know the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of God ſtandeth ſure, having this Seal, <hi>The Lord knoweth who are his;</hi> Yet have a care, <hi>Let every one, who nameth the Name of Christ, depart from iniquity,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.19. <hi>Make your calling and Election ſure,</hi> How is that? by giving all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to add to your faith vertue, to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue knowledge, to knowledg temperance, to temperance patience, to patience god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, to godlineſs brotherly kindneſs, to brotherly kindneſs charity; for, if ye do theſe things, ye ſhall never fall. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7, 8 9, 10. We can be no further aſſur'd of our Salvation by Chriſt, than we can be ſecur'd of our being in Chriſt, and conforming our lives to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Rules. The ſecurity we can have in this preſent ſtate of grace may not be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined to be the ſame with that we ſhal have in the ſtate of glory. It is only the Saints departed, who have enter'd the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:136233:81"/> Ark of Heaven, can ſing that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of the Apoſtle. <hi>Death is ſwallowed up in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.54. We that are below in this Church militant, muſt be ever up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Watch, ſaying with holy <hi>Job, All the days of my appointed time, or warfare here on earth will I wait till my change come,</hi> Job 14.14. And our change will come ſooner or later. The wheel of nature, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.6. is ever turning, and turning ſome off into the duſt every day; like <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> we are continually run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning one after another to the Sepulchre. The beſt Antidote I can preſcribe unto you, I will not ſay againſt Death, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the terror of it, that Death may looſe its ſting, and the Prince of Terrors may not be terrible, is this, to look upon your ſelves all your life time; if of the number of the predeſtinate, to be prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, to be conformed to the Image of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. To live as he lived, to walk as he walked, to make his ſpirit your guide, his word your rule, his life your example; In all Scripture the holy Spirit of God hath revealed unto us but one way of preparing for death, and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:136233:82"/> our future eſtate, which is by an holy life. Faith may ſhew us Heaven, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> at a diſtance, but it is holy life, and an habitual ſanctity muſt land us there. The Text I have now pitched upon may ſettle us upon this bottom, if we will but ſeriouſly weigh and conſider of the two Propoſitions, which are indeed two undeniable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines ariſing out of it. 1. That all men muſt die. 2. That all Men, after death, muſt come to Judgment; As the Tree falls ſo it lies, and as Death leaves us, ſo Judgment will certainly find us. 1. <hi>All Men must die.</hi> This is ſo unqueſtionable a verity, that I never yet heard, or read of any that durſt offer at a confutation of this Propoſition. <hi>Jews, Heathens, Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> all confeſs it, and have in one kind or other their <hi>Juſta,</hi> or Funeral rites, their <hi>Officia poſtremi muneris,</hi> which they perform at the Funerals of their dead. This ſtatute of dying was made in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19. not yet repeal'd. <hi>Debe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur morti nos noſtraque,</hi> to die is as good a debt as any the world knows, for the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying of which there is an extent upon all
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:136233:82"/> Man-kind, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. This mortal muſt be put off that immortality may be put on. Thoſe <gap reason="foreign">

I need ſay no more for confirmation of the firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. Let us ſee in the next place what uſe is to be made of it; if we muſt all die and depart hence, this being not our reſt, not our home, but our way home. Let us make proviſion in our life time for that time of dying, which will moſt certainly come upon us, though it be moſt uncertain when; Let us think e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day of dying, for indeed we die dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:136233:83"/> as ſoon as we are born we begin to die; Let us make death familiar by expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, by daily apprehenſion of it; Let us at all inſtants go out to meet it, and think our ſelves always upon our Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. He deſerves not (ſaith <hi>Jerom</hi>) the name of a Chriſtian, who will live in that ſtate of life in which he would not die— Indeed it is a very great adventure to be in an evil ſtate of life, becauſe we know that every minute of it hath a danger, and we know withall, that after death, there is ſomething elſe to be looked af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which brings me to the next particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. <hi>That all Men after Death muſt come to Judgment.</hi> This is a Propoſition carrying in it a very great truth, which <hi>Pagans, Turks,</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> I mean the moſt ſober and beſt moraliz'd amongſt them have not been ignorant of. How <hi>Heathens</hi> came by this knowledg, whether by the light of nature, or by ſome Revelation unknown to us, or happily by ſome light derived from our Scriptures, I am not able to ſay, nor curious to enquire; for my way hath ever been to ſit down contented with my own ignorance in things, which are in the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:136233:83"/> dark, and wherein I may ſpend much time in the diſquiſition, and find but little ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction at laſt.

When this final Judgment ſhall be, I will not determine; Let curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heads meddle with theſe curioſities, I dare not; I will not ſo much as deſire to know what God was not willing to reveal.

            <head>The Thanksgiving of Women after Child-Birth. <hi>Commonly called</hi> The Churching of Women.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Note</hi> 1. OUr Church of <hi>England</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent in her Liturgy and publick Offices, both for her Charity to Man, and Piety to God, hath preſcribed to Us in Her Service-Book two notable Paſſages, as relating to Child-bearing-Women. 1. In the Litany, we are taught to pray in a general way for all Women labouring with Child, that is, for their ſafe deliverance in ſo great a danger, which is ſo great, that the Spirit of God being to lay out a danger to the full, expreſſeth it thus, <hi>As travel upon a Woman with Child,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.3. noting both the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denneſs, and ſharpneſs of the pains. Now
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:136233:85"/> there was a curſe we know inflicted upon Woman-kind for <hi>Eve</hi>'s ſin, That they ſhould bring forth Children in ſorrow, or with ſore travel at their birth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.16. Every Child ſhould be to her a <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oni,</hi> and <hi>Filius Lachrymarum;</hi> becauſe the Woman was the cauſe and beginning of ſin and ruine on all Man-kind. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.14. However God is pleaſed to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the curſe, ſo that Woman ſhall be able to paſs through her Child-bearing ſafe, though not without ſome difficulty and danger; and this curſe no queſtion is not ſo heavy upon Woman-kind, as that ſin deſerved, by means of the ſeed of the Woman, the <hi>Meſſias</hi> which ſhould be born from her Poſterity. For no doubt he would redeem that nature which he was to aſſume, and did aſſume, not only from the danger of Child-bearing, but from a greater danger of eternal damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon condition that theſe Child-bearing-Women continue in the Faith, and live in that Charity, Holineſs, and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety as they ought to do, performing thoſe Duties of Chaſtity and modeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, which Chriſtianity requires of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:136233:85"/> them. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15. Yet notwithſtanding the curſe of Child-bearing is moderated, and mitigated, it is not taken away, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains ſtil ſo as to expoſe the Woman to very great danger; which motive puts the Church upon it conſtantly to pray, for all Women labouring with Child. I wonder ever any Women who have been ſenſible of theſe dangers, ſhould be taken captives by thoſe ſpirits of errour, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Teachers, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6. which creep firſt into their houſes, and then into their hearts, ſo as to be brought to a loathing and diſlike of that moſt excellent Prayer, which the Church hath inſerted into her conſtant Morning-Service for their ſafe deliverance. 2. Here is a peculiar Office for the purpoſe, wherein the Woman is to return her praiſe and thanks to God for her deliverance, when the pain is ov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r, and the danger is paſt. Had the Church never enjoyn'd this, our own reaſon may tell us this is fit to be done. Firſt to pray to God for his mercy we would receive, and then to praiſe God for his mercy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. That ſo our duty may keep pace with God's bounty, and our grateful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:136233:86"/> anſwer in ſome proportion God's gracious deliverances. Certainly as the Apoſtle ſpeaks this is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. A ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rational Service, a Service that hath very much of reaſon in it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. and none but ſuch, who have little reaſon, and leſs religion in them can be againſt it. No Chriſtian who hath grace and gratitude in him, but will bluſh at that pitiful and poor Objection which is made againſt it, as if, forſooth, in returning thanks for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one thus delivered, and vouchſafed this mercy, we ſhould be like the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Hereticks, who do nothing elſe but pray. Indeed I think of the two, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being like ſuch Heretiques, who do nothing but pray, than to be like ſuch Schiſmatiques and diſquiet Spirits, who do nothing but rail and quarrel at what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is ſo prudently ordered and eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by lawful Authority; and this is the judgment of a very reverend Man. <hi>Hook. Eccleſ. Polic. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>ſect.</hi> 74. <hi>David</hi> tells us it is a good thing, a thing very well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the juſt, and religious Perſons to be thankful. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.1. I like not that godlineſs which teacheth any
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:136233:86"/> Man to be unthankful. Among the Ten Lepers, which were cleanſed, our Saviour took notice but of one that returned to acknowledg the mercy. <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.17, 18. Chriſt in commending of him, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the other Nine. Yet we read not of any ſpecial command injoyning one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to return back, and to give thanks; only the nature of the benefit received did in all reaſon require it. By which it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that when God is merciful to us, we are bound up by reaſon as well as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to be thankful to him. And where can a Woman expreſs her thanks to God for ſo great a mercy, better than in the Congregation, and that for theſe reaſons. 1. To evidence her own thankfulneſs. 2. To provoke others to the like thankfulneſs by her example. 3. To excite all to make ſome reflexion upon the firſt ſin, which laid ſo heavy a curſe, expoſing them to ſo great a danger, upon Woman-kind. 4. To work in Children an impreſſion of love, duty, and obedience towards thoſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of theirs, who did undergo ſo much pain and ſorrow to bring them into the World. Neither know I, how or which
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:136233:87"/> way Children can ever make amends, or ſufficiently requite their Parents. Now in regard this return of Thanks is to be performed in the publick, and in the Face of the Congregation, it is intitled, <hi>The Churching of Women.</hi> For ſo ſoon as God gives them ſtrength, and they have retired themſelves ſo long time, as is conſiſtent with the Chriſtian rules of modeſty and ſobriety, it is very fit they ſhould come in decent and humble manner, and make a publick acknowledgment of Gods great mercy to them in the preſence of God's People, then met together in Gods houſe; neither do I conceive how the great end of this Office, according to the Churches intention, can be exactly performed and diſcharged, to have it hudled up in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and obſcurely in their private hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, nor indeed done at all, unleſs the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary grant forth a diſpenſation in a caſe of apparent neceſſity; which it concerns the Church to be very wary in granting, in regard (as I have obſerved) in this irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Age we have ſo many groſs and dead-hearted Chriſtians, that they are apt to pretend a neceſſity where really
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:136233:87"/> none is, and Midwifes in ſuch caſes made too often guilty of the midwifery of lies, by which means the publick Offices of the Church are too much abuſed, and ſcandalouſly ſlubber'd over in private Houſes.</p>

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:136233:88"/> for according to the judgment of <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> I cannot conceive what hurt can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be in a Veſtment, where the wearers are not faulty. <hi>Tertul. lib. de pall.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath fully determin'd in the caſe touching all indifferent things, <hi>That to the pure all things are pure,</hi> Tit. 1.15. that is, they who ſtrictly abſtain from unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful freedom, may with a ſafe Conſcience uſe any lawful liberty. But the uſual Veſtment worn for diſtinction at this time by the Woman, was a comely Veil, to be as a token of her modeſty and ſubjection; for the uſe of the Veil had that meaning in it in the Apoſtles time, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.10. So <hi>Photius</hi> tells us in his <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 210. The Woman ought to be ſubject to the Man, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. and to bear the ſign of her ſubjection, a covering on her Head. Such kind of covering every Woman ought to wear in the Congregation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.5. But if the Woman be ſingled out from the reſt, to joyn with the Miniſter, in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging any Chriſtian duty, as in this caſe; Then queſtionleſs ſhe ought to have a Veil, not only for decency, but for
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:136233:89"/> diſtinction too, as being to ſit in a more eminent place in the Congregation, to pay her thanks to God for her ſafe delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from ſo great a danger; which Veil may not only mind her of her ſubjection, but teach her alſo to make reflexion upon that firſt ſin wherein the Woman was the firſt, which brought the Sex firſt under ſubjection, and withall ſubjected them to the great danger of Child-birth. Indeed ſome ſuperſtitious Perſons, who are apt to create fears to themſelves, where there is no ground of fear, which is the right meaning of ſuperſtition taken in a bad ſenſe, ſcruple more at this Veſtment than at the committing of a groſs ſin; and where-ever this Veil is uſed, I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it may be to convince theſe pittiful Chriſtians of their groſs ignorance, who ſcruple ſo at every indifferent thing, that they do not only deſtroy all Chriſtian duty, but all Chriſtian liberty too, which they ſo much contend for. I do not read it injoyned by any Eccleſiaſtical Canon, nor by any injunction of the Church, only it is a civil cuſtom, and faſhion of the Country, and hath no more offence in it,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:136233:89"/> than the wearing of new Gloves at Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, or blacks at Funerals. Dr. <hi>Whitgift.</hi> Defence of his Anſwer to the Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Fol.</hi> 537.</p>

Now the Woman at this time hath a peculiar offring of praiſe and thankſgiving to offer up to God for her deliverance, and therefore it is fit ſhe do it in moſt decent and humble manner. But as to the convenient place, we muſt take our directions from cuſtom, and the Ordinary, however in caſe it be more within the publick view, and the publick hearing, than any other place, the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, and as neer to the Communion Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as may be approached, the Woman not preſſing or preſuming within the Rail which is a place peculiar to the Prieſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

Of the greatneſs of her danger. 2. Of God's goodneſs to her in her deliverance.</p>

                  <hi>Verſ. 2.</hi> Now ſeeing he hath thus graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly heard my requeſt, and bestowed upon me the mercy which I prayed for, I ſhall when ever my calamities approach me, or ſeize upon me, apply my ſelf by my prayers chiefly and ſolely to God, and however I neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect not any other lawful means, yet will I make him my chief trust, and dependance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ. 3.</hi> My dangers indeed, which by the ſtrength and goodneſs of my God I have eſcaped, were very great, menacing death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ. 4.</hi> And when I had ſmall or no
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:136233:92"/> hopes of reſcue left me from any humane means, I made my addreſs to God's over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling help and providence, I humbly and fervently beſought him in my Prayers, that he would ſend me a ſeaſonable deliverance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ. 5.</hi> For certainly thought I, be my dangers what they will, yet I have a merciful and faithful God in whom I truſt, who will make good his promiſe of mercy, to all who depend upon his promiſes, and faithfully by prayer ſolicite him for performance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ. 6.</hi> It is his proper attribute to be the ſupporter of the weak, and the reliever of thoſe who are in diſtreſs, and accordingly hath he dealt with me in my greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ. 7.</hi> And now being thus reſcued by him, and delivered from thoſe dangers which did encompaſs me, I have nothing to do, but to ſerve him in all ſincerity, and integrity of converſation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ. 8.</hi> For he hath reſcued my life from death, wiped all tears from my eyes, reſtored me from my weakneſs to a perfect ſtrength and ſoundneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ. 9.</hi> Therefore will I ſpend the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of my days, which he ſhall afford me
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:136233:92"/> in this World, in his ſervice, and at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent make my humble addreſs to the place of God's ſpecial preſence, there to celebrate that mercy, which he hath afforded me in ſo ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal a deliverance;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ. 10, 11.</hi> When my calamities were moſt preſſing, and my dangers greateſt, by which I was clearly convinced, that the arm of fleſh was not to be truſted in for my relief; yet I knew there was one ſure hold, to which I might hopefully and ſucceſsfully reſort, the never failing Omnipotent hand of God, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to that I betook my ſelf entirely, and from that I received my deliverance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ. 12, 13, 14.</hi> For this, and for all other abundant mercies, which God hath ſo graciouſly beſtowed upon me, I am bound up by all obligations, to make my most thankful acknowledgment, and to do it in the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn manner, in the preſence of the whole Congregation, by way of publick Feſtival, bleſſing and magnifying God's Holy Name, who hath preſerved my life from ſo great a danger, and kept it as a Jewel of his own Cabinet, as being by me humbly depoſited with and intruſted to him. And this is his gracious way of dealing, not with me only,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:136233:93"/> but with all who truly rely and depend upon Him. For which ſignal mercy of his, I here preſent my ſelf at this time, to pay that gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and oblation of praiſe, which if I did not promiſe in my danger, yet am now bound up to perform after my deliverance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ. 16.</hi> O most gracious Lord, how am I obliged to Thee, by all the bonds that any ingagement can lay upon me? No Servant bought with a price, or born in a Man's houſe, can be more cloſely bound to him, than I am bound to Thee, who haſt reſcued me by ſo great a deliverance from ſo great a danger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ. 17, 18, 19.</hi> What remains now, but that I ſhould return to Thee the humbleſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frings of praiſe and prayer, and ſpend my whole life as a vow'd oblation to thy ſervice, rendring Thee all poſſible praiſe in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Aſſembly, and in the moſt ſolemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſaying, Bleſſed be the name of the Lord, or, Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghoſt; As it was in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is now, and ever ſhall be, World with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end, <hi>Amen.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ. 1.</hi> There is no way in the World to attain any ſecular wealth or ſafety, ſave on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the bleſſing of God, the author and diſpenſer of all good things; The building up of Houſes and Families, of gathering Riches, and begetting Children to inherit them, is not to be imputed to Man's ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, but is wholly imputable to God's bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Unleſs God by his ſpecial protection guard a City, all the guards of Men can do

               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ. 2.</hi> 'Tis to little purpoſe for Men to deny Nature that reſt, which God hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged to her, to moil inceſſantly, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar themſelves the enjoyment of worldly comforts, thinking by this means to inrich their Poſterity, for they who truſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon their own anxious, and ſollicitous indeavours, are generally fruſtrated, and diſappointed in their aims and ends; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they, who take God's bleſſing along with them, thrive inſenſibly, and become proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, though they never looſe any ſleep in the purſuit of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ. 3.</hi> And for Children, that's a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular bleſſing of God's, from whom all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe comes, and he gives them as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and ſees good, as a preſent reward to the piety, and other virtues of Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ. 4.</hi> And of all bleſſings this of a numerous Progeny is the greateſt, every Child being an addition of ſtrength and ſafety to the Father; Children of Youth are as arrows in the hand of a mighty Man, and defend the Houſe from Hoſtil Invaſions, as well as Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons can.</p>

               <p>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THis is the firſt early inſtance we have in Scripture for Church-Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline. <hi>Gratian</hi> derives it hence. <hi>Diſtinct.</hi> 50. <hi>c.</hi> 64. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſeems to derive it hence. <hi>Haereſ.</hi> 52. and ſo doth <hi>Jerom.</hi> in <hi>Hoſ. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 6. and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in <hi>Geneſ. ad lit. lib.</hi> 11. <hi>c.</hi> 40. and many others; and if ſo there is not only Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for ſuch a Diſcipline, but the moſt ancient of Scripture: An ancient godly
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:136233:107"/> Diſcipline of putting notorious ſinners to open Penance, which it ſeems is loſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, and we only wiſh, as there is cauſe enough for it, a happy reſtauration of it. It was indeed when it was uſed as it ought to be, a very laudable and edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way to reform the ſcandals of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and to make Chriſtians in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to be Chriſtians in their lives and converſations too. It is ſtrange that the only reforming diſcipline ſhould be aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned thoſe Churches, which are ſtiled the Reformed; that excommunication ſhould be it ſelf excommunicate; and that driven out of the Church, which ſhould drive out vice. And I wonder a whole Nation ſhould vote the reſtaurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, and ſo few in the Nation ſhould endeavour it. It is a ſign that vice hath overtopt Chriſtianity, hath gotten the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hand of all Laws, both Political and Eccleſiaſtical, and that may very well be, for we, who live in this age, cannot be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant how many good Laws have been made for the correcting of vice, and how few executed; either we love vice ſo well that we will not, or we have indulged it
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:136233:107"/> ſo much, that we dare not bring it to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Penance. But God, who was neither pleaſed with it, nor afraid of it, did; for when <hi>Adam,</hi> the firſt of Man-kind, and King of the whole World under God, had tranſgreſſed his poſitive Law, and committed a great ſin in breaking an eaſie Commandement, he brought him to his confeſſion, his open and full confeſſion, though he came unwillingly to it, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed many evaſions and equivocations, which the Tempter taught him to uſe, who firſt taught him to ſin; he gave him an Aſh-Wedneſday Lecture, for the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony of Aſhes, from whence this Day derives the name, came from his <hi>Pulvis es, Dust thou art, Gen.</hi> 3.19. and he put him to his Penance. <hi>In moerore, in ſudore.</hi> In ſorrow ſhalt thou eat, and in ſweat. He, who abuſed his indulged innocent pleaſures, ſhould live with afflictions, thorns, and thiſtles, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.17, 18, 19. The promiſed Seed gave him hopes of pardon, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. but he muſt paſs this Penance firſt, and that he might paſs it, he muſt quit his Paradiſe, be driven for a time from the preſence of the Lord. So
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:136233:108"/> 
               <hi>He drove out the Man,</hi> &amp;c. This was the firſt great Specimen of Church Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, it is Primitive and ancient enough, as ancient as the Church it ſelf, and it is authentick and authoritative enough, for God himſelf was the author of it, and it was practiſed in the Church before the Law, till ſin was ſo imperious that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could reform it but a Deluge, and under the Law, till wickedneſs was ſo predominant, that nothing could quell its power, but a <hi>Babylonian</hi> captivity, &amp; in the time of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> till Vice was ſo prevalent amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> that nothing could check the rage of it, till the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagles fell upon <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> like Birds of Prey upon a Carkaſs, and in the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Churches of the Apoſtles planting, till ſin was grown ſo much in defiance of the light, that God was pleaſed not only in Juſtice, but in Mercy too, to withdraw the Candleſtick; and in all Churches of the Chriſtian World was this Chriſtian Diſcipline uſed, this godly Diſcipline (and where it was moſt uſed, there Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity moſt flouriſhed) till corruption had gotten the ſtart of Chriſtianity, and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:136233:108"/> Chriſtianity and Covetouſneſs, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worſe had made a match. But now it is every where either too much abaſed, or elſe almoſt totally abandoned, ſo that it is no wonder Chriſtians in name ſhould be worſe than Heathens in manners, when the Chriſtian Church is without Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, when the Tares and the Wheat, the Goats and the Sheep, the Chaff and the good Corn, the Droſs and the Gold, the Unclean and the Clean, the Vile and the Precious muſt all promiſcuouſly make up one communion in the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of moſt holy things, and no Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Diſcipline is uſed to make ſo much as a tolerable ſeparation, ſo that in the Church Militant here on Earth, ſin is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Triumphant part. But in Heaven, where no unclean thing ſhall ever enter, it ſhall not be ſo, <hi>For fleſh and blood can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not inherit the Kingdom of God, neither corruption inherit incorruption,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.50. God hath here in the Hiſtory of the firſt original of all our humane race o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to us this great truth, wherein there is a Hiſtory as well as a Myſtery; what is ſpoken of <hi>Adam</hi> and Paradiſe, of
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:136233:109"/> 
               <hi>Adam</hi> placed in Paradiſe, whilſt he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained innocent, and of <hi>Adam</hi> brought to confeſſion, penance, and removed out of Paradiſe, when he became notoriouſly criminal, is hiſtorical, but it is written <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, by way of a type and enſample in reſpect of us, and ſo is myſtical, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all notorious criminals, who live in the boſom and bowels of the Chriſtian Church, and are a reproach to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian name, and a ſcandal to Chriſtian profeſſion, are to be removed, are to be brought to their confeſſion, penance, and to remain ſometime ſeparate from the community of Chriſtians, whoſe holy Laws and Lives they will not conform to. This was God's Law, and this was Gods practice, but as godly as we pretend our ſelves to be, I do not ſee that we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe God's Copy, and draw his practiſe into imitation: We ſuffer many ſcandals in the Church, ſeek no removing of them, ſuffer Vice to be accounted Vertue, and Vertue to be accounted criminal, and ſeek no redreſſing of it. <hi>Adam</hi> innocent, and <hi>Adam</hi> a tranſgreſſor is all one to us, he ſhall remain in Paradiſe, though the curſe
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:136233:109"/> of briars and thorns grow up and remain with him, he may eat of the tree of ſin, and when he hath done ſo, come without any controul to the Tree of Life, if it was poſſible, without doing his penance, ſo little do we regard who comes, or what is done in the Church which is the Paradiſe of God. Church Officers are much to be blamed as to this particular, who do not duly and truly preſent ſuch Criminals. But God would not have it ſo, would not ſuffer it to be ſo. For, <hi>He drove out the Man, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That I may give you an exact model of the godly Diſcipline which the Primitive Chriſtian Church uſed at the beginning of Lent, or much about this time of the Year, I ſhall take my Scheme from this firſt pattern of it ſet by God himſelf, in his ſevere dealings with lapſed <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo long as he kept his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, remained innocent, and had done nothing notoriouſly criminal, to deface that divine and glorious Image, which God his Maker had ſtamped upon him, had all Paradiſe at his command; he might freely take the fruition of God's
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:136233:110"/> Creation, and enjoy his Creator in a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and a contemplative life. Thus he was <hi>In statu inſtituto,</hi> in his firſt and innocent eſtate; but when he became a delinquent and a Tranſgreſſor, and ſtood convicted of a notorious ſin againſt his Maker, when the Serpent in ſubtilty had beguiled <hi>Eve,</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in ſimplicity had deceived <hi>Adam,</hi> and under the ſpecious pretence of being like unto God, and wiſe in knowing good and evil, he made himſelf a ſinner againſt God, loſt that wiſdom which he had by refuſing the good, and chooſing the evil, then God took a ſevere courſe with him to humble him for his pride, and to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify him for his preſumption, Paradiſe the Garden of his pleaſure was turned into a place of his penance and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and he loſt the liberty of thoſe fruitions, which he had made a forfeiture of by a too great licentiouſneſs, God put upon him his Penance Robes, cloathed him in skins, the badges of his ſin, and the covers of his ſhame, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.21. So in imitation of this practiſe of God the Church in the Primitive times did deal with her criminals, ſuch as apoſtatized
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:136233:110"/> from Chriſtianity in times of Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or ſuch as were convicted of hereſie, Schiſm, Contumacy, Perjury, Adultery, Drunkenneſs; or any other notorious crimes, which were a ſcandal to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian name, or a reproach to Chriſtianity, and they were the ſtricter and ſeverer in this Diſcipline, not to magnify the power of the Keys, and Authority of the Church above the mercies of God, for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are inexhauſtible, and all our ſins to them are but as a drop to the Ocean; but they were the more ſevere in it, becauſe Chriſtianity was but then in the bud, and the profeſſion of it was thinly diſperſed in the crowd of <hi>Pagans,</hi> where the leaſt moral ſcandal would have been a great blemiſh to the whole party, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently have impeded the gaining of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelites. For it is an infallible rule that no Sect whatever can thrive and proſper, whoſe Profeſſors do not exhibit a fair front of moral Vertues in their outward actions: Upon this account it was, and it was expedient too, that the Church under the penalty of the deepeſt of her cenſures, required from all her ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:136233:111"/> ſuch a practical and exemplary pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as might render her moſt reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, even in the opinion of her greateſt enemies. Neither was the Church Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick ſo ſevere, but the Novatians the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Puritans in <hi>Affrick,</hi> as they ſtiled themſelves, were much ſeverer, for they when they excluded criminals out of their communion, did ſhut them for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver out, which ſeverity <hi>Cyprian</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in them, and ſo did <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and wrote ſeveral Books and Epiſtles againſt them, as being too over-rigid and cruel in their Diſcipline towards their lapſed Children, exerciſing rather the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Step-Mother, than of a natural and indulgent Mother; Yet though <hi>Affrica</hi> was always very fruitful of Monſters, this ſevere Diſcipline of theirs did keep out vice and ſcandalous crimes from their Churches. And when the Church ceaſed to carry a ſtrict hand of Diſcipline over her delinquent Children, grew remiſs and relax, and every day more and more gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle towards notorious criminals, ſin did quickly get the head of ſanctity, and vice juſtle out vertue, and debauchery driv
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:136233:111"/> out this very Diſcipline it ſelf, ſo that for want of it now we may take up the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of <hi>Iſaiah, How is the faithful City become an Harlot, it was full of judgment, righteouſneſs lodged in it, but now murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Thy Silver is become droſs, thy Wine mixed with Water,</hi> Iſay 1.21, 22.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> both, for <hi>Eve</hi> was the firſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor, and was firſt in the tranſgreſſion. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.14. God did not preſently ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate them, and caſt them out of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe; but he called them firſt to a ſtrict account, and interrogated them touching their ſin, of which they were convict in their own conſciences, as appeared by the covers which they made for to hide their nakedneſs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.7. and by their hiding themſelves from God, when they heard his voice in the Garden, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.8 9, 10. GOD ſummons them to appear before Him, with all their ſin and guilt about them. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.9. And although they uſed many wryings and turnings from the matter, minſings and ſhiftings, tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and paſſing off their faults from one to another, <hi>Adam</hi> confeſſing his naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:136233:112"/> but not his ſin: <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.10. And when he could not hide his ſin, laying it not upon himſelf, but upon his Wife, as his Wife did upon the Serpent. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.11, 12, 13. Yet God by his ſtrict examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on brought them to ſuch a ſenſe of it, that they could not chooſe but ſee how notoriouſly criminal they were, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to abide any longer in that Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of God, wherein they had injured the Majeſty of ſo glorious a God, and abuſed the mercy and goodneſs of ſo gracious a Creator. So in the Primitive Church of Chriſtians, before the notorious ſinners and criminals were caſt out of the boſom of it, they were aſſigned their Confeſſors who were to examine them, to take cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of their crimes, to lay open their ſin, and their danger, and to make them throughly ſenſible of the injuries and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities they had offred to Chriſt, and to make them ſee clearly how unworthy they were, to live in the ſociety and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Chriſtians, and to partake of the Prayers, Sacraments, and Priviledges of the Church, who by their hainous ſins, and notorious crimes had ſo much defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:136233:112"/> Chriſt, ſcandalized the Chriſtian community, and brought a reproach e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven amongſt Heathens upon the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Name. Now this buſineſs of confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or taking confeſſion, was not intruſted to any, but to thoſe, who were moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in the Church, for their prudence, piety, ſanctity, and integrity, and ſuch as could be as Chriſtianly ſenſible of the faults of others, as if they were really their own, who had the wiſdome of the Serpent to diſcern, and the innocency of the Dove to determine in ſuch caſes, and knew how to diſtinguiſh betwixt weak and wilful ſinners.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When <hi>Adam, Eve,</hi> and the Serpent, whoſe ſhape the Devil had abuſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them both, had paſſed their exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and confeſſion, (but it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the Serpent was not examined, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did make any confeſſion.) <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.14. Then God promiſed to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> a gracious Pardon in the promiſed Seed: <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. But he brought them to do Penance firſt, the Serpents puniſhment ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than his Penance, was to go upon his Belly, and to feed upon duſt all the days
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:136233:113"/> of his life. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.14, 15. The Womans Puniſhment and Penance both, was to bring forth Children with ſorrow, and to be in ſubjection to her Husband, whom by her imperiouſneſs ſhe had deceived; <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.16. being aſſured of hopes of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, through a Child that ſhould be born of Woman-kind, that is, the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> if ſhe and her Sex continued in faith and charity, and holineſs with ſobriety. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15. The Man's puniſhment and penance was to eat his Bread in ſorrow all the days of his life, to live amongſt thorns and thiſtles, and to ſpend his days in a kind of mortification for his intemperance, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.17, 18, 19. And when God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced them this Penance, he cloathed the Man and the Woman like Penitents, in Coats of Skins, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.21. So in the Primitive Church, when ſcandalous Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians had paſſed their examination, and confeſſion, then they were aſſigned their Penance by their Penitentiaries, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, according to the rate and aſſize of their crime and offence, which Penance they were to perform ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, and to give ſome clear evidences of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:136233:113"/> their reformation, and amendment before they were to be readmitted to Chriſtian communion, but in ſome caſes to thoſe eſpecially, who were in extremes, the Church was indulgent, and did deal <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, more favourably. Now when the Penance was aſſigned them, and they became <hi>Canonice poenitentes:</hi> then as God cloathed <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> with Skins, ſo they were cloathed <hi>in ſilicio &amp; ſordibus,</hi> in ſack-cloth and aſhes, to teſtify to the World, that they were fallen, and by ſin become as the vileſt things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> and Laſtly, When <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> had paſſed their Examination, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, had received the Sentence of their Penance, and were cloathed with Skins, like Poenitentiaries, then they preſented themſelves at the Door of Paradiſe, and were driven thence. So <hi>He drove out the Man;</hi> and ancient Writers conclude it to be much about this time of the Year; and therefore in imitation of God's pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, did the Primitive Church (about this time of the Year) cauſe all Penitents to preſent themſelves at the Church door cloathed in Sack-cloth, with their Feet
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:136233:114"/> bare, and Viſages dejected, and while they were ſo preſented, they were led into the Church by their Penitentiaries, all the whole Church lying Proſtrate on the Floor to bewail their offences; and after the Seven Penitential <hi>Pſalms</hi> were ſung, the chief Governor or Biſhop of the Church, the Presbyters in a fraternal conſociation joyning with him, did ſprinkle aſhes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their heads, covered them with Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, and with ſighs and ſobbs denounced this Sentence againſt them, that as <hi>Adam</hi> was expelled out of Paradiſe, ſo they were thruſt out of the Church for their iniquities, and after this they were driven out, all the Clergy purſuing them with this Reſpond, <hi>In the ſweat of thy brows ſhalt thou eat thy Bread,</hi> Gen. 3.19. That ſo theſe poor ſinners ſeeing holy Church ſo afflicted and diſquieted for their ſins, might be made the more ſenſible of their Penance; This is briefly the Scheme of the ancient godly Diſcipline, which may eaſily be proved, as to the moſt material parts of it, out of the Evangeliſts, the Writings of the Apoſtles, and Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Men. But now there are ſcarce any
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:136233:114"/> Foot-ſteps of it remaining, and that is certainly the Reaſon why the Chriſtian World is grown ſo prodigiouſly vicious; onely we have here an Office appointed in the ſtead of it to be read upon this day, wherein we do not wiſh that curſes may fall upon our own heads, as ſome ſlanderouſly report of us, only we affirm with our own mouths, that the curſe of God is indeed due to ſuch ſins as the Church here propounds it. The uſe of this Office is to make us flee ſuch Vices for the future, and earneſtly to repent of them, if we be guilty, as we acknowledg that the curſe and vengeance of God doth deſervedly follow ſuch ſins and ſinners.</p>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; a Day moſt-what ſo ſpent, as if our Belly was our God, and eating and drinking our Godlineſs. In Primitive times (it is moſt certain) the practiſe was otherwiſe, but the beſt cuſtomes in tract of time gather Corruptions. That which was once a Day of ſhriveing, confeſſion, and penance, and a more ſevere preparative to the Faſt enſuing, hath of late Years by a too much indulged liberty gained a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:136233:116"/> Name of <hi>Guttage-Tueſday</hi> among the <hi>Plebs,</hi> as if, Eat, Drink, and be merry, was the Motto of the Day, and Work of the Day too. Was it poſſible like the Philoſopher mounted on the top of a Hill, to have noted, and taken a view of all Yeſterday-paſſages, we ſhould ſcarce have met with any like the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of this Day. No one paſſage fit to uſher this Day in, but many admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring cauſe enough to have ſuch a ſevere and godly Diſcipline, which the Church wiſhes the reſtoring of, to follow at the heels of it. Yeſterday, <hi>Vivebant Baccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalia, qui hodie Curios ſimulant.</hi> What debauchery and intemperance in many Places? What luſting after the Fleſh-Pots, which we were ſo ſhortly to leave? The Bell that rang Yeſterday, was no Saints Bell I am certain, no Service, no Sermon-Bell. <hi>Venter non habet aures.</hi> We were too full fed, to be well taught. <hi>Vox Populi;</hi> the Voice of the People was ſo loud, that <hi>Vox Dei,</hi> the Voice of God could not be heard. The Cocks of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtocles</hi> might be brought forth to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themſelves for the Battel, firſt to
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:136233:116"/> feaſt our Eye, and then to fill our Bellies, but I am confident St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Cock could not be heard amongſt them to call us to Repentance, and to prepare us to the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, to fight againſt ſin, and to War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe Luſts, which War againſt the Soul. So that this Text as Yeſterday would not have timed right, well let us ſee what it will do to Day! <hi>To Day if ye will hear his Voice.</hi> Why? what is to day? <hi>Dies Diem docet.</hi> The very Day teacheth us what the Day is, and what is to be done upon it. <hi>Aſhwedneſday,</hi> The word is, <hi>Vox decompoſita,</hi> twice compounded, and out of it we may pick a double meaning. <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> that was ever in the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, which we follow in many of our Cuſtomes, a Day of Solemn Faſting, every <hi>Wedneſday</hi> throughout the Year, unleſs it chanced upon a Feſtival, and the Reaſon is, becauſe upon a <hi>Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday</hi> it was, that <hi>Christ</hi> was betrayed and ſold by <hi>Judas,</hi> a gracious Saviour betrayed by a graceleſs ſinner, a good Maſter ſold by a wicked Servant, Well, why <hi>Aſhwedneſday?</hi> This <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſuperadditum,</hi> which ſprinkles the day
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:136233:117"/> with aſhes, and Chriſtens it by a new name, intimates ſomething, indeed it minds us of a Ceremony uſed by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians as upon this Day, as I noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; which was to give Aſhes one to another. The Ceremony is gone, what is there of the ſubſtance left? The aſhes are blown away, but I hope not the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of them; what-ever becomes of the Ceremony, the ſubſtance would be retained. Did theſe Aſhes mind us of our Mortality, of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as St. <hi>James</hi> phraſe is, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.6. of Natures Wheel ever turning, and turning ſome Daily into the Duſt: No, that was not the meaning of them. For Duſt had been more proper to have done that. Duſt to duſt, our Mortality is grounded upon <hi>Pulvis es, &amp; in pulverem reverteris,</hi> Gen. 3.19. But the Aſhes were to mind us of ſomething more, as we uſe to ſay, No ſmoke but ſome Fire, ſo no Aſhes but ſome Fire; Aſhes ſome derive from the <hi>Hebrew Eſch, Ignis,</hi> Fire; So that the meaning of that Ceremony of Aſhes was to mind us of Fire, that Fire, which is of ſins kindling, which nothing but the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:136233:117"/> Tears of Repentance, with the Blood of Jeſus, can quench; <hi>Non eſt iste ignis ſicut qui ardet in foco tuo.</hi> This fire is another manner of fire from that on our harths, or in our Kitchens; ours may be quenched, that is unquenchable. It is a terrible thing to think of dwelling in conſuming fire, ſuch as ours is; but ours as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes, ſo it will be conſumed it ſelf, we could not always dwell in it, becauſe it cannot always laſt, the very Veſtals them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves could not keep it always burning; but there is mention of everlaſting burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>Iſay</hi> 33.14. where the fire ſhall be ever burning, and never going out, where ſinners ſhall be like <hi>Moſes</hi> Buſh, always burning, but never conſumed.</p>
            <p>Thus have you the meaning of this Day, why called <hi>Aſhwedneſday;</hi> and the meaning of the Aſhes, which gave it the Name, to mind us of thoſe everlaſting Burnings, which by faſting and penance, mortification, and amendment of life we may be kept from. This is the terror of the Lord, which this Day preacheth; knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. That being forewarned, ye
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:136233:118"/> may be forearmed, and the wrath to come may never come upon you. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.7. Let not this Day be as Yeſterday was, not a Day of Feaſting, but Faſting, not a Day of appetence to ſatisfie fleſhly luſts, but a Day of abſtinence, to mortifie them. If ye were in the 6th. of <hi>Amos</hi> Yeſterday, ye muſt be in the 2d. of <hi>Joel</hi> to Day, and thither the Church, by the choice of her Epiſtle for this Day calls you. This Day is <hi>Caput Jejunii.</hi> The firſt Day of the <hi>Lent</hi>-Faſt. Let us not paſs it over, as if we were to begin our <hi>Lent</hi> too ſoon, and put it off till to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. <hi>Qui non est hodie aptus, cras mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus;</hi> He who is unfit to amend his life this Day, may be more unfit to morrow. Neither are we aſſur'd of to morrow. This firſt Day of <hi>Lent</hi> may be the laſt Day given us to repent in. Therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin your repentance to day, to morrow may be too late. Now ſaith the Lord, <hi>Turn ye unto me,</hi> Joel. 2.12. Do not ye turn God's <hi>Nunc</hi> into <hi>Nondum,</hi> now into not yet, his <hi>Hodie,</hi> to Day, into <hi>Cras,</hi> to morrow. <hi>Felix,</hi> who thus plaid with Religion, and put off hsi repentance, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:136233:118"/> for his own convenient time, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.26. might never find it for ought I know, but I paſs on from the Day, to the Duty this Day calls for.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>If ye will hear his Voice,</hi> That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the end of our coming hither, to hear God's Voice, to hear it, and do it; to know our <hi>Lenton</hi>-duty, and to do it when we know it. It is not every Voice of God that muſt down with us this day; not his Voice ſpeaking in the cool of the day, yet that Voice was enough to terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our firſt Parents, and to make them hide themſelves under the covert of thoſe Trees, of whoſe fruit they had furfetted. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.8. Neither is it his ſtill ſoft voice that we are to hear, yet that made <hi>Elijah</hi> to cover his face with his Mantle, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.13. Look not like thoſe in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> for a jeſting Song, or for a pleaſant Voice this day, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.32. Take the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> bring hither the <hi>Tabret,</hi> the merry <hi>Harp,</hi> with the <hi>Lute;</hi> that's the voice for a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Feaſt Day, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.2. but that's no voice for a Solemn Faſt Day, ſuch as this is. <hi>David</hi> tells us of another voice, fitter a great deal for this Day. God's
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:136233:119"/> voice in thunder, his mighty voice, ſuch a voice as breaks down Cedars, divides it ſelf in flames of fire, and makes the very Wilderneſs to tremble, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 29. A voice that could ſpeak hard Rocks into ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Water, and Flint-ſtones into ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wells, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 114.8. That was a Voice proper for us now. What ſay you to the Voice in <hi>Iſay,</hi> which calls you back from your wandrings, ſaying, <hi>This is the way walk ye in it,</hi> Iſay 30.21. What ſay you to <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt's Voice, whoſe voice was God's too, calling out of the Wilderneſs for Repentance and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Life, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.2. Nay, what ſay you to the Eccho of that voice, which ſpeaks more than the voice it ſelf, and calls not only for Repentance, but for fruits worthy of Repentance. That tels us, it is not enough to perſwade our ſelves, that we have <hi>Abraham</hi> to our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, unleſs we do the works of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and tread in the ſteps of his moſt holy faith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.8, 9. Nay, what ſay you to that Voice, which is like an Axe, laid to the Root of the Tree of Sin to cut it down, a Voice threatning us, that if we
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:136233:119"/> will not be for fruit, we muſt be for fuel, and out down by one Judgment or other, and caſt into that fire, which the very Aſhes which give this Day a Name may forewarn us of, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.10. Many ſuch Voices there are in Scripture, that are the proper Voices for this Day. Voices not to raviſh the Ear, but to rend the Heart, Heart-breaking Voices. Such Voices, I preſume are now uttered in the Court, enough to make the Royal Robe to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Sack cloth, as it was noted of the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.30. and if the Court be in Mourning, it is not fit City or Country ſhould be in a poſture of rejoycing. Away then with thoſe <hi>Magiſtri ſecundum deſideria,</hi> thoſe Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers after our own Luſts, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks of, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3. This is not a time for <hi>Placentia.</hi> The moſt ſeaſonable doctrin now, is, that which calls for Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Mourning, Tears and Prayers, Sack-cloth and Aſhes. Now bring forth your Calves of Sin, which ye have been making all the Year, and burn them in the Fire, turn them to Aſhes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.20. and ſo how-ever the Ceremony of
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:136233:120"/> this day be loſt, Let us retain the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. But I ſhall not ſtay you longer upon this Subject; The Church, which enjoyns the ſtrict obſervance of this day, that we may know what voice of God is moſt ſeaſonable and ſuitable for us to hear, hath ſorted out her Scriptures pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely in the choice of her Epiſtle and Goſpel for this day, taken out of both Teſtaments, out of <hi>Joel</hi> for the Old, and St. <hi>Matthew</hi> for the New. We have Gods Voice ſpeaking in both, and preaching to us, Faſting, Repentance, Mortification and Amendment of Life. The Epiſtle is part of <hi>Joel</hi>'s Sermon, the Goſpel is part of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Sermon, and both may make one compleat Sermon, the Heads of which are ſumm'd up in other words, in a ſhort Prayer or Collect for the day. But that I may not ſo keep this day now, as to break the Orders of the Church, and by offring at a Sermon which is not enjoyned, (although the Court-practiſe may be our Preſident) let go the very Office of the Day, which is enjoyned: Give me leave now to acquaint you with a penitential Service placed at the end of the Service
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:136233:120"/> Book, which may be uſed at other times of the Year, but muſt always be uſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Day. It conſiſts of the Litany, which is a good penitential Prayer, and of choice Sentences taken out of both Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are very fit for the work of repentance, and of <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51. which is a penitential <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and other choice Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers following fitted to the ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Penitents. But becauſe there are many curſes in it, and the People are enjoyned to anſwer, <hi>Amen,</hi> after every curſe, leſt any ſhould take occaſion thence to quarrel the Service, as if we were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to curſe our ſelves, and as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid, to call down a curſe upon our own Heads, and not a bleſſing. <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.12. To remove this ſcruple, I am firſt to tell you, That the Churches Voice herein is God's Voice, the Church enjoynes no more than what God himſelf enjoynes. <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.15. Now for the word, <hi>Amen,</hi> give me leave to explain it; it is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a wiſh or prayer, but ſometimes only an aſſent to the truth of that, to which it is added; and ſo is it in this place; we do not wiſh that theſe curſes
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:136233:121"/> may fall upon our Heads, but only affirm with our own Mouths that the curſe of God is indeed due to ſuch ſins, as the Church here propounds it. And the uſe of it is to deter us from ſuch, and the like ſins, to make us repent of them, if we are guilty, as very well knowing that God's curſe and vengeance doth deſervedly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſuch ſins, and ſinners: So that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we are enjoyned with <hi>Moſes,</hi> as it were to go into Mount <hi>Ebal</hi> this day, and to pronounce theſe curſes, which can be no very pleaſing task. For according to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Proverb, we muſt creep into <hi>Ebal,</hi> and leap into <hi>Gerizim,</hi> that is, be ſwift to bleſs, and ſlow to curſe. Let them note this, who were not many years ſince ſo ready at their <hi>Curſe ye Meroz,</hi> wreſting and abuſing a Text of Scripture againſt the clear ſenſe and meaning of it, rather than the King, Loyal Nobility and Clergy, and all the faithful People of the Land ſhould not be curſed: which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how this Church of ours, both in her Articles of Religion, Liturgy, and Canons ſtands divided from <hi>Rome</hi> ſo far as ſhe is divided from her ancient ſelf,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:136233:121"/> may perſwade any rational Man to believe that they received their Orders from the Conclave of <hi>Rome</hi> ſo to do, they wanted nothing but the Ceremony of Bell, Book and Candle to ſpeak them as very Papiſts as ever upheld the Popes intereſt, Their <hi>Curſe ye Meroz,</hi> as they apply'd it, differ'd nothing from the Pope's Bull, and his thundering Curſe of Excommunication, for how it wrought upon the ſeduced vulgar, and drew them off from their Allegiance is apparent to all, but only thoſe, who are reſolvedly blind, and will not ſee. But I go on now to ſpeak of the Curſes in the Commination Office. For if we can but avoid the curſed thing, avoid the cauſe, which makes the Curſe to fall, it may hover over, but not alight, nay, it may flie over as a Bird, but not fall down upon us as a Bird of prey. If we do but frame our practiſe up to the Churches meaning, theſe Curſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced will be but like <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows ſhot to <hi>David,</hi> to warn us, but not to wound us. For be confident, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver evil of puniſhment may fall upon us for our evil of ſin, if we go on, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:136233:122"/> in it; The one will never fall the evil of puniſhment, if we flie the other, the evil of ſin: Our Repentance (if it be as it ought) will cauſe God's Repentance. If we turn from the evil we have done, he will turn from us the evil which he may juſtly do, and inflict upon us, even all thoſe evils (as it is in our Service-Book) which we moſt righteouſly, that is, moſt juſtly have deſerved. So that unleſs we have a mind to continue in our ſins, and to turn to them, like the Dog to his vomit, or the Swine to her wallowing in the Mire, rather than turn from them, as <hi>Moſes</hi> from his Rod, when it was a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, there can be no danger in reading the Commination, and the many Curſes in it; for upon our turning from ſin, and turning to God, God can turn theſe Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes all away, and inſtead of them leave a bleſſing behind him. But then, as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the laſt part of this Text.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Harden not your Hearts.</hi> Hardneſs of heart was <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s great ſin, and his puniſhment as well as his ſin: So that God is ſaid one while to harden <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart, and in that ſenſe hardneſs of heart
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:136233:122"/> was a puniſhment. God did harden it, that is, God did not ſoften it. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> is ſaid another while to harden his own heart, and in that ſenſe, Hardneſs of heart was a ſin; <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did harden it, that is, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did ſtand out againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> by a perpetual Rebellion, and would rather run the hazard of having all <hi>Aegypt</hi> deſtroy'd, then let the People of God go out of his tyrannous hands. But thoſe very People of God, how little warning did they take by <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding? How were they guilty of that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſin, for which they ſaw <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and all <hi>Aegypt</hi> ſmarted? inſomuch that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, hardneſs of heart became as it were the proper note of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As little as <hi>Moſes</hi> Miracles wrought upon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> ſo little did <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles work upon them. The Miracles, which would have converted <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sydon,</hi> could not reclaim <hi>Chorazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida;</hi> The mighty Works, which might have preſerved <hi>Sodom,</hi> could not keep <hi>Capernaum</hi> from deſtruction, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.21. It was indeed their hardneſs of heart, their obſtinacy, and reſolved im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:136233:123"/> that kept many out of <hi>Canaan,</hi> who came out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and tranſported many into <hi>Babylon,</hi> who came into <hi>Canaan.</hi> That brought them under the ſcourge of <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> and the Rod of <hi>Aſhur,</hi> and at laſt under the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagles to be prey'd upon, waſted, and conſumed to nothing; ſo that that Nation, which was God's own Nation, adorned with many Priviledges and Prerogatives above other Nations, is now no Nation, but diſperſed among all Nations, to be a warning to all Nations. That as <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath it, <hi>Ex cinere Judaeorum fiat lixivium Chriſtiano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum;</hi> out of the very Aſhes of that ruin'd Nation, we may gather up ſome (this <hi>Aſhwedneſday</hi>) and make a Lee of them to beſprinkle our Eys, and to ſupple and mollifie our hard hearts, that the ſame ſin, which procured theirs, prove not alſo our ruine. Hardneſs of heart brought ſuch a fall upon them, that unleſs our hearts are as hardned as theirs, we cannot chooſe but fear at their fall, and look to our own ſtanding, when we read of them fallen. <hi>Miror quorum facta imitamur eorum exitus nos non perhorreſcere.</hi> But what is it,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:136233:123"/> think you, that cauſeth this hardneſs of heart? Whence proceedeth it? Truly it proceeds from the heart it ſelf, from ſome errour there. They err in their hearts, not in their heads, but in their hearts. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.10. It lies not ſo much in the underſtanding, as in the will, a weak underſtanding doth not contribute ſo much to this Soul-murdering ſin, as a wicked will. Therefore the Apoſtle's caution is not ſo much againſt an errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous head, as an evil heart. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12. An unfaithful, unthankful heart, a heart apt to tempt God, to provoke God, a heart that is more inclinable to grieve God with ſin, Forty Years together, then to be grieved for ſin. A heart that will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from God, rather than depart from ſin, from the living God, rather than from any one beloved ſin. When an evil heart, and the deceitfulneſs of ſin meet together, when Sin and the wily Serpent both joyn to deceive the heart, and the heart is as willing to be deceived by them, this is it, which produceth in time hardneſs of heart. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13. But now to keep us from this ſin, which unleſs we are kept
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:136233:124"/> from, Salvation it ſelf cannot keep us from periſhing, the Church hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch times of auſterity as theſe, to mortifie our luſts, and to mollifie our hearts: And hath framed up a Service proper for this Day, to bring the heart, if poſſible, into a good frame. So that the ſins which we are moſt prone to, are preſented to us with a ſting in the tayl of them, uſher'd in with a <hi>Maledictus,</hi> Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is ſuch a ſinner for ſuch a ſin, and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up with an <hi>Amen,</hi> ſo it is. God ſays it, and the People ſeal it; The Miniſter goes before with a Commination, and the Congregation follows after with a Confirmation. But that none of theſe Curſes to be pronounced by us may fall upon us, but all beſide us, I deſire you that as you have heard God's Voice ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by me, ſo now ye would with a little more patience hear God's Voice ſpoken by the Church, and ſo having given you in part the Reaſon for this Days obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance: I come now to conclude with the proper Office framed up for the better obſervance of it, and ſo in the cloſe we ſhall ſhut up with the Miniſters <hi>Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>

However the circumſtance of place is not much material, yet I obſerve the vulgar and groſſer ſort of Chriſtians, who have more zeal than light, make a great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it, and take the Ordinance of Preaching (I think) to be of more univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal concernment than the great duty of Prayer, for no other reaſon, but becauſe the Pulpit ſtands higher then the Pew, in ſo much (I am able to ſpeak it out of a known experience in places where I have been) that the very ſame Sermon deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:136233:127"/> in the Pew hath been taken for no Sermon, nor edified at all, which hath wrought vigorouſly and powerfully when paſſionately, and with another action and tone, delivered out of the Pulpit; Nay more, I have known another experiment tried of the judgment of theſe Zealots, who preſume themſelves to be the only knowing Chriſtians, by taking the Book of Homilies, which I judg to be none of the worſt Sermons, becauſe compoſed by moſt able and learned men where were more heads than one in the contrivance of them, theſe I have known read in the Pew where they had no more reliſh or taſt than <hi>Job</hi>'s white of an Egg, but the ſame Sermons advanced a ſtep or two higher, and delivered (by the advantage of a Text of Scripture fitted to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily only prefixed) with a graceful acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or knack, as they call it out of the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, have paſſed in the worſt of times, when Preaching was moſt in faſhion, for moſt excellent and Soul-ſaving Sermons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> By which it is apparent that the very Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit and Place, eſpecially when the Hour-Glaſs is turned up to add the more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:136233:128"/> is very much to the making of a Sermon for the pleaſing, at leaſt, if not for the profiting of ſome humoriſts; In ſo much that I have often queſtion'd it within my own thoughts, whether if Common Prayer was advanced into the Pulpit, and Preaching brought down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Pew, theſe eaſie ſort of Chriſtians (and yet not ſo eaſie to be brought to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or diſciplin) would not miſtake Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer for Preaching, and Preaching for Prayer, and ſo become in time as very Recuſants, in reſpect of preaching, as they have been and ſtill are in point of Prayer. But I hope, ſo long as we have good laws made, there will not be that want of the due execution of them, as that Miniſters ſhould make uſe of ſuch wiles and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſallacies to ſeduce the People out of their errours, and to couzen them into conformity.</p>

                     <hi>O Lord God, who art great in power, rich in mercy, whoſe glory is above the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, whoſe goodneſs is over all the Earth; who art Almighty, for in Heaven; who art moſt merciful, for our Father; in Heaven ſo able to help us, our Father, ſo willing to hear us: Lord, what art not thou able to do for us, who art in Heaven? Lord, what art not thou willing to do for us, who art our Father? Here we lie proſtrate before Thee upon the Earth, yet preſſing in our affections towards the Heaven where thou art, and preſume not for any merit in us, but for thy mercies in Chriſt, that thou wilt deny us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which may do us good, who vouchſafeſt us this to call Thee Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Petit.</hi> Thou art an Holy God, and delighteſt that all thy Worſhipers ſhould
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:136233:133"/> worſhip Thee in the beauties of holineſs; we deſire Thee to ſhed thy Holy Spirit abroad in our hearts, that we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this our bounden duty and ſervice in an holy manner, that we may lift up holy hands, with holy hearts to Thee, who dwelleſt in the Heavens; Thou, who art the ſanctifier of all that is made holy, make us to be holy as Thou art holy, give us holineſs in our thoughts, words, and actions; ſanctify us inwardly, and outwardly in our Souls and Bodies; make us holy in our lives, that we may be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py at our deaths. Let thy Name of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be hallowed in us, and upon us, that we may in our lives and converſations walk before Thee in newneſs of life, and as it becometh the Sons of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Petit.</hi> To this end we humbly beg of Thee to ſanctifie our corrupt nature, and to beautifie our debauched ſouls with thy grace; extirpate ſin, that grace may be implanted; break the power of ſin in us, bruiſe Satan under our feet, and ſet up the Throne and Scepter of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in our hearts; bring down every exalting thought
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:136233:134"/> and proud imagination in us, to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Chriſt; tranſlate us out of the kingdom of Darkneſs, into the Kingdom of thy dear Son. Let not Sin, nor Satan reign in us, but let thy Son reign in us by the Scepter of his Holy Spirit. May thy Kingdom of Grace come to us, that we may come to thy Kingdom of Glory.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>Petit.</hi> And, O Lord, we deſire Thee to cloath our Souls with thoſe Divine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, that we may love the ſame love, chooſe the ſame objects, and delight in unions and holy conformities with Thee: Lord, ſo incline our hearts and affections that we may make thy providence, which is the guide of the World, the meaſure of our deſires; that we may be patient in all accidents, and conform to thy will both in doing and in ſuffering, that we may ſubmit to all changes, even to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions for thy Holy Name. Make us to do thy will in the manner of Angelical o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, promptly, readily, cheerfully, and with all our faculties; as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in Heaven ſerve Thee with concord, harmony, and peace; ſo may we joyntly
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:136233:134"/> ſerve Thee here on Earth with peace, and purity, and love unfeigned. That we may have nothing in us that may diſpleaſe Thee, but that quitting all our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and pretenſions, we may live in all Angelical conformity; Make our Souls ſubject to Thee, and our paſſions to our Souls, that thy will may be done by us here on Earth, as it is done by the Holy Angels in Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 <hi>Petit.</hi> And, O Lord, we pray Thee to give us all that is neceſſary for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of our lives; that portion of bread, which is Day by Day needful for us; we pray Thee for the poor, who want it, and have it not, but as it is depoſited in thy hand. Let thy mercy (O Lord) plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fields of Heaven, bring them in their Meat in due ſeaſon; we pray Thee for the rich, who have it, and yet may ſtand in need of thy bleſſing with it; From the higheſt to the loweſt we all wait upon Thee, that thou would'ſt be pleaſed to feed us with food convenient for us. We beg but for a Day, that we may always have our dependance on Thee to miniſter to us as we need it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1. For the preſerving of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an charity among all, who profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be Chriſtians, take theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Directions. There are great diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and diviſions gotten in already a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, by reaſon of ſome different perſwaſions, about ſome things in their own nature indifferent, however all are not ſo perſwaded; theſe have cauſed ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities, ſidings, and ſeparations amongſt us, ſo that the communion and peace of the Church, the moſt precious thing to be preſerved is more than likely to be broken. Therefore to make up this breach, that it prove not incurable by continuance, I make this ſeaſonable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication; and firſt I admoniſh thoſe who do not think themſelves obliged to the uſe of thoſe indifferent things, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:136233:139"/> others who think themſelves bound up in Conſcience to their obſervance; but to receive them to their communion, and not to quarrel with other Mens reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions and perſwaſions as to ſuch things, but to direct their own lives by what in conſcience they are perſwaded is lawful or unlawful about ſuch matters, in caſe the things indifferent in their nature are left alſo indifferent in their uſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2. For he, who is ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in his Chriſtian liberty, makes uſe of his Chriſtian liberty, and makes no ſcruple at all about ſuch things, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth he place any religion in them (further then to expreſs his obedience to lawful Superiors, which is not the leaſt part of Chriſtian Religion) whereas he, who is weak, and not ſufficiently inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the nature of the liberty allow'd him by Chriſt, ſo long as he remains in that errour, reckons of ſuch things as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean in themſelves, and not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3. But let not him, who diſcerns his Chriſtian liberty in ſuch matters, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe him who is ſcrupulous and errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:136233:139"/> neither let the ſcrupulous and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous reject and caſt out of his commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion thoſe, who are better inſtructed in the nature of their Chriſtian liberty, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God hath admitted them into his Church, and received them as Servants into his Family.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 4. And what commiſſion can any pretend to judg the Servants of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and owned by him, or to exclude them out of the Church touching ſuch matters, ſeeing they muſt ſtand or fall, be cleared or condemned by God's Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and not Man's; God is able to clear them if he will, and he certainly will, having received them into his Family, and given them this liberty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5. Some Judaizing Chriſtians obſerve the Sabbaths and other Rites ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by <hi>Moſes;</hi> others, who know their liberty, make not that difference of times and things which <hi>Moſes</hi> Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; in ſuch things, Let every Man act by his own Conſcience, and not by another Mans, what he is verily perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he ought to do, and let not the unity and peace of the Church be broken for ſuch matters.</p>
               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:136233:140"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 6. &amp; 7. He, who makes a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence betwixt days, as they were differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd by <hi>Moſes</hi> Law (this is nothing to our Chriſtian Feſtivals obſerved upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother account) thinks it is God's will he ſhould do ſo; and he, who doth not make that difference, thinks it is God's pleaſure now under Chriſt that he ſhould not make it. So is it for Meats, as well as for Days; ſome who underſtand not their liberty make a difference, from the ſuppoſed obligation of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who are very well inſtructed in their Chriſtian liberty, make no difference as from <hi>Moſes</hi> Law (however from Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Laws a difference may be made as to the uſe, but not as to the nature of Meats and Days which Chriſtian-Laws Chriſtians who rightly underſtand their Chriſtian liberty will cheerfully obey) certainly when both ſides do what they do, meerly out of conſcience, and to do a thing pleaſing to God, this is well done, for no Man is to do what himſelf likes beſt, but what he thinks to God is moſt acceptable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 8. For our life and death are very
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:136233:140"/> inconſiderable, but as by them we may ſerve God, ſo ought we to do it in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 9. This being the great end of Chriſt's death, Suffring and Reſurrection, that he ſhould have power over us all, and command and give what liberty he pleaſeth. (but further then he gives we may not take, nor pretend to ſuch a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian liberty as unavoidably deſtroys Chriſtian duty.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 10. But why do we condemn our fellow Chriſtians, or exclude them from our Communion; Why do we vilifie, ſet them at naught, or judg them, ſo long as they only uſe, and do not abuſe their Chriſtian liberty in conforming to the uſe of ſome things, (which not the nature of the things themſelves, but the juſt Laws of lawful Superiours make neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary) indeed neither are to be Judg one of another in ſuch things, but Chriſt is to be the Judg of all, being ſent by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and commiſſionated to that Office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11. As it was long before predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, <hi>Iſay</hi> 45.23. which Prediction was to have its completion in Chriſt incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:136233:141"/> 
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9, 10, 11. who is conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the one Supreme Judg of all, to whoſe Judicature every one muſt ſubmit, and give account for his own actions. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is very unreaſonable that one pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Chriſtian ſhould judg another, and reject one another from Communion, for this belongs only to Chriſt, and thoſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of his Church, who are his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates, and are endowed with the power of the Keys and Cenſures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 12. Therefore let this fault be mended by you that are fellow-Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; do not any longer cenſure and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from one anothers communion for ſuch indifferent and circumſtantial things as theſe are; only be careful not to ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize the weaker Chriſtians, by putting ſtumbling blocks in their way to hinder their coming clear over to Chriſtianity; caſt no gall-traps in the way of weak Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daizing Chriſtians to wound their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and to cauſe them to fall back from Chriſtianity, which they will be in danger to do, when they ſee thoſe liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties uſed among Chriſtians, which they deem utterly unlawful.</p>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:136233:141"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14. I am confident, and make no queſtion but that by the coming of Chriſt the Moſaical difference of Meats is taken away, and all Meats are lawful in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be eaten by Chriſtians; but yet the ſame Meats are unlawful to thoſe, who are ſo perſwaded in their conſcience, and have not yet attained to the right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of their Chriſtian liberty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 15. But if thou, who underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thy liberty, doſt for a matter of this nature deſpiſe and caſt off thy Fellow-Chriſtian, who underſtands it not, and by ſo doing doſt diſcourage him from going on in Chriſtianity; Surely thou walkeſt contrary to the rule of Chriſtian charity, which is, to draw all to piety, and to drive none away; and this will be a great fault in thee, for ſo light a thing as this, to drive him from Chriſtianity, and ſo deſtroy him, for the ſaving of whom Chriſt was content to lay down his Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 16. Ye may uſe your Chriſtian liberty, but ye do not well if ye ſo uſe it, as to make it tend to an others hurt, for
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:136233:142"/> that will be the defaming of that, which is in it ſelf indifferent or innocent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 17. Chriſtianity conſiſts not in ſuch external matters, (when left indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in their uſe, as they are in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and not commanded by lawful Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors for decency and order) but in the practiſe of Chriſtian vertues, ſuch as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> things not ſinful, mercy, peace, delight to do one another good, to build up one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in piety, not dividing, and hating, and excommunicating one another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 18. All theſe are acts of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Chriſt, that are ſure to be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God, and to be of good report a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all good men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 19. Therefore let us moſt zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly attend to theſe things, which may thus preſerve peace between all ſorts of Chriſtians, though of different perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and which tend to the drawing Men to Chriſtianity, not driving them from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 20. Let not ſo inconſiderable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:136233:142"/> liberty, places any Religion further than obedience to the juſt Laws of lawful Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours) diſturb that peace and unity, which ought to be among Believers, though of different perſwaſions, about indifferent things. For a Man may eat any thing ſimply conſider'd, but if by ſo doing he aliens others from the Goſpel, by deſpiſing and avoiding them, who dare not do ſo, this is a ſin in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 21. It is not charitable to make uſe of any part of Chriſtian liberty, when by thy ſo doing another Man is deterred from the Chriſtian faith, and by ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy occaſion of thy miſuſed liberty, is ſo galled and wounded in his Conſcience, as that he cannot with any inward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort or ſatisfaction go on in the diſcharge of his Chriſtian duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 22. If thou haſt a clear under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of thy Chriſtian liberty, it is well for thee; but uſe it betwixt God and thy ſelf, not always before Men, when it may be in danger to hurt them, and when it is not neceſſary to reveal thy pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 23. But there is no reaſon that the ſcrupulous Chriſtian ſhould be evil intreated by thee for not daring to do as thou doſt, when he thinks himſelf in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience otherwiſe obliged; for it would be a damning ſin in him to do what his conſcience tells him is an unlawful action; For whoever does any thing (though the thing be in it ſelf lawful) which is in his perſwaſion ſinful, and unlawful, he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſins in ſo doing.</p>

We, who are Orthodox Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, have that knowledg of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian liberty, (and therefore ought not to be deſpiſed by thoſe, who in pride of heart ſeparate themſelves from us) that together with our knowledge, we hold charity and the love of God, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines us to ſuffer any thing for Chriſt's ſake, ſo that an Idol-feaſt is no trouble to our Conſciences, for we need not to come at them to ſave us from perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a little of this courage and love of Chriſt is much better than all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

Therefore if Men pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with an Opinion of knowledg, from ſuch ſubtilties as theſe, and ſo come to deſpiſe other Men, and not conſider what tends to their good and edification, they are far from the true Chriſtian know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or from directing it to the right end, which is charity, and the edification of our Brethren.</p>

Yet all Men are not of this perſwaſion, that theſe Idols are nothing, for ſure if they thought ſo, they would not worſhip them; nay, ſome are of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that they are ſomething, and are able to hurt them, and therefore they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their Heatheniſh cuſtom, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the Idol-Feaſts, notwithſtanding theſe very Perſons have received the faith of Chriſt; ſo that their ſick and ſinful Conſciences are defiled and polluted by ſo doing.</p>

Now a Man, who is not of this perſwaſion towards the Idol, if he goes to the Idol-Temple with the Idol-Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, may be a means of confirming them in their Error, it being certain that they will think he comes as they come, with the ſame Opinion of the falſe deity, and of reaping ſome benefit by it, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience muſt needs be very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>

So that the Chriſtian of an erroneous Conſcience ſhall go on in his ſin, and be in danger to be ruined, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the others practiſe, who preſumes upon his knowledge, and ſo goes confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to the Idol, as a meer vanity and thing of nought, not at all conſidering the erroneous Conſcience of his weak Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and ſo he makes himſelf guilty, not only of uncharitableneſs to his Brother, but of injury to Chriſt, in betraying a Soul to ruine, for the ſaving of which Chriſt died.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 12. And be it granted, that, for one who underſtands his Chriſtian liberty to be preſent at an Idol-feaſt, be not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety againſt God, yet is it an act of great uncharitableneſs againſt the weak Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, in bringing them to a confirmation in thoſe ſinful practiſes, wherein through error they are already, and ſo it may be an impiety and ſin againſt God too, who is concerned in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 13. Therefore if to eat a Feaſt in an Idol-Temple, or any uſe of my liberty in the ſame kind, be an occaſion of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming any Chriſtian in an erroneous ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:136233:146"/> practiſe, or of bringing him to do any thing, which is unlawful, I will be ſure to deny my ſelf the uſe of that liberty (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it be ſuch, as by the Laws of Chriſt truly belongs to me) when it ſhall prove of ſuch dangerous conſequence to my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note.</hi> Whatever hath been ſpoken by way of a plain Paraphraſe out of the forementioned places of Scripture, makes nothing at all againſt any Mans confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the uſe of the Common-Prayer-Book, now by Law eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Nothing out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, for theſe following reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe no Man, who is a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an can poſſibly be ſo weak in the faith, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he be wilful too, as to ſcruple at pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er as ſuch, it being the great duty of a Chriſtian, or at Prayer in a ſet-form, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is authorized out of both Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and was ever the practiſe of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Church ſo to pray, or at the ſet-form of Common-Prayer eſtabliſhed in our Church, becauſe it is conform to all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Liturgies, and to the Liturgy of the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:136233:146"/> 
                  <hi>Roman</hi>-Church too, (is not denied) ſo far as that is conform to the Prayers of the ancient and primitive Church, but no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, beſides every branch of it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to the Lords Prayer, the Creed, and Ten Commandements, is agreeable to Scripture, and moſt delivered in the very Scripture-phraſe; and framed up according to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s preſcribed Model. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>Vid.</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond.

               <p n="2">2. All this ſuppoſed, and as eaſie to be proved as ſuppoſed; I believe no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian can pretend to that tenderneſs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as to be grieved in his conſcience for doing that, which is ſo agreeable to God's Word, and the practiſe of all the Church-Chriſtian all the World over.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nothing out of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Conformity, unleſs theſe weak Chriſtians will ſay, which I know they will not, leaſt they ſhould be accounted wicked, rather than weak. 1. That God is an Idol. 2. That to pray to God in his Houſe of Prayer, or to be preſent at Chriſtian Feſtivals and Services in his
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:136233:147"/> Temple is Idolatry; beſides if any ſhould be ſo perverſe, and yet mask it under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of tenderneſs of conſcience, as to be offended at us in ſo doing, and by ſo doing diſcharging our duty, I do not ſee how we can leave off theſe things to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie them, for we have conſciences as well as they have, and as tender, apt to be grieved, as theirs; and we underſtand our Chriſtian liberty as well as they do, and it may be in ſome things better too, for we know this liberty is not ſo in our power, as to uſe it and not uſe it, when we pleaſe to gratifie and comply with every paſſion and diſtemper, but we are bound up by Laws, which by Authority deriv'd from God's Laws, have power to bind the conſcience, to ſerve God in ſuch ſet-forms, and at ſuch ſet-times, neither do I ſee how any power upon earth can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige us from obedience to thoſe juſt Laws, which are impos'd upon us by lawful Superiors, how can we to ſatisfie another Mans conſcience, take off our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience from thoſe, whom we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be ſubject to, not only for wrath, but alſo for conſcience ſake, <hi>Rom.</hi>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:136233:147"/> 13.5. our Chriſtian liberty hath freed us from the Ceremonial Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but not from any Chriſtian rules left us by Chriſt and his Apoſtles. We muſt not uſe our liberty for a cloak of maliciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.16. nor pretend it to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy Chriſtian duty; Chriſt hath freed us from many yokes, but not from that of ſubjection to God, and lawful Superiors. I deſire, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, that our moderation, and meekneſs may be made known unto all Men. <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.5. Yet we muſt not be ſo moderate to Men, as to be cruel and injurious to God; whatever the Law of Chriſt forbids may not be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated, any thing in its own nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides is tolerable enough, there is nothing intolerable but ſin, and for Magiſtrates to tolerate that, who have a power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain it, is to make themſelves guilty of the commiſſion of it. To deny the true God, and ſet up a falſe is intolerable, it is againſt the firſt Commandement. To worſhip God after our own wills, and not according to Gods will is intolerable, it is againſt the Second. To take God's Name in vain in words, or works, in
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:136233:148"/> words to ſwear for him, in works to ſwerve from him, to pretend for Him in words, and practiſe againſt him in works, is intolerable, it is againſt the Third. To make all things common, and nothing ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, is intolerable, againſt the Fourth. To deſtroy order, and bring in confuſion, to cry down Magiſtracy and Miniſtry, to bring in a parity, where God would have a ſuperiority, to impower the Servant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Maſter, the Child againſt the Parent, the Subject againſt the Soveraign, and ſo make one Mans will a Law to take away another Man's life, is very intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and a breach of the Fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. This is the Commandement we have moſt a ſpite a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, but it is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment which p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſerves us all, and in the well keeping of it, conſiſts upon the matter the well obſervance of all the reſt. To give another Man power to take away my life, to defile the Matrimonial Bed, to injure a Man in his goods or good name, to have a will to do it when he cannot, and actually to do it whenever he can, are all intolerable, and breaches of the other Commandements. If ſuch things as theſe
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:136233:148"/> may be tolerated, nothing is intolerable; nay, nothing but will be intolerable, though tolerated; for I think it as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable to live where all things are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated; as where nothing is. No Man, who hath any Religion at all, can pretend a Toleration for theſe things, which are againſt all Religion, and all Reaſon too. Now becauſe the Laws of God have ſo little influence upon Mens lives, unleſs there be <hi>Cuſtodes utriuſque tabulae,</hi> in the Church, to ſee that both Tables be kept, that of Religion, and that other of Juſtice; Therefore God hath inveſted Magiſtrates with a power and authority, and leſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Precepts to command our obedience and ſubjection to them, for to make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther humane Laws to preſs on the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of God's Laws, and that Gods Law of Religion may be obſerv'd in the beſt manner, the Church hath framed up Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies, inſtituted decent Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, all according to Apoſtolick Rules. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40. and if Men may be indulged a liberty to be exempt from humane Laws, which are as the Ark wherein Religion is preſerved,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:136233:149"/> God's Laws will in time be of very little regard among us; Thus have I (good Reader) only to give ſome People ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, if poſſible, taken upon me this task upon the Common-Prayer-Book, to work People into a better eſteem of it, and that they may without any ſcruple of Conſcience conform to it.</p>
